Issues discussed:

#75: Reorganize spec

We agreed to reorganize spec to place basic software vectoring first,
and hardware vectoring later.  This does not change the spec, or
declare what's mandatory, but just want to reorganize the document for
readability.

#61: NMI

There is a separate proposal for resumable NMI that is more general
than just for CLIC.  Krste to email out the proposal to general tech
list.

#45, #59: CLIC and CLINT running concurrently in different privilege
 modes

We agreed to support having at least switchable between only CLINT and
only CLIC across privilege modes when hardware supports both.  This
does not mandate that a system must support both.

There was debate about supporting CLIC in one priv mode and CLINT in
another priv mode.  A motivating example was to have a simple
interrupt controller in M-mode (for security verification) and allow
more featureful controller in U/S-mode (for application performance).
Consensus was that this needs clarification on how this will work.

#54 Adding CSIP software interrupt bit

The original motiviation was to provide a software interrupt that was higher
fixed priority than timer but lower than other interrupts.  The group
is considering dropping this, but needs further discussion.
