Number of Attendees: ~10
Current issues on github: https://github.com/riscv/riscv-fast-interrupt/blob/master/clic.adoc

Issues discussed:

#29 Specification of debug triggers for CLIC interrupt

Group generally agreed that CLIC interrupt triggers should be
configured through memory-mapped registers.  The group discussed
changes to the proposed memory map, including only requiring 32b word
writes, and moving interrupt enable to top of field and interrupt ID
to bottom.

One unresolved issue is whether triggers should be on pending
interrupts, and/or pending and enabled interrupts, and/or the next
interrupt to be taken.  The CLIC group members will confer with debug
group to resolve.

#39 WARL for edge/level spec

Group agreed with WARL definition for this field, and so closed the
issue.

#(no number)

Finally, the group spend some time discussing auto-clearing of
edge-triggered interrupts.  The consensus was that the clear must
happen on entry to the ISR.  Another concern was around race
conditions if an ISR wants to check for further interrupts inside
handler.  Memory-mapped access to read/clear the IP bits has race
problems, so recommendation is to use the mnxti CSR instruction to
access/clear any further interrupts.

The group decided we need a logic diagram of the configurable
level/edge input to help resolve questions around specification of
what happens when edge/level configuration is changed during
operation.
