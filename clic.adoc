= SiFive Proposal for a RISC-V Core-Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC)
Version 20180622

== Background and Motivation

The CLIC is designed to provide low-latency, vectored, pre-emptive
interrupts for RISC-V systems.  When activated the CLIC subsumes and
replaces the existing RISC-V local interrupt scheme (CLINT).  The CLIC
design has a base design that requires minimal hardware, but supports
additional extensions to provide hardware acceleration.

NOTE: While the current CLIC design provides only hart-local interrupt
control, future additions might also support directing interrupts to
harts within a core, hence the name (also CLIC sounds better than HLIC
or HIC).

NOTE: The hardware-accelerated extensions are not specified yet.

=== Existing RISC-V Interrupts

The existing RISC-V interrupt system already supports interrupt
preemption, but only based on privilege mode.  At any point in time, a
RISC-V hart is running with a current privilege mode.  The global
interrupt enable bits, `mie`/`sie`/`uie`, held in the
`mstatus`/`sstatus`/`ustatus` registers respectively, control whether
interrupts can be taken for the current or higher privilege modes;
interrupts are always disabled for lower-privileged modes.  Any
enabled interrupt from a higher-privilege mode will stop execution at
the current privilege mode, and enter the handler at the higher
privilege mode.  Each privilege mode has its own interrupt state
registers (`mepc`/`mcause` for M-mode, `sepc`/`scause` for S-mode,
`uepc`/`ucause` for U-mode with N extension) to support preemption, or
generically {epc} for privilege mode ``*_m_*``.  Preemption by a
higher-privilege-mode interrupt also pushes current privilege mode and
interrupt enable status onto the ``**__m__**pp`` and ``**__m__**pie``
stacks in the {status} register of the higher-privilege mode.

The {tvec} register specifies both the interrupt mode and the base
address of the interrupt vector table.  The low bits of the WARL
{tvec} register indicate what interrupt model is supported.  The
original settings of {tvec} mode (`*00` and `*01`) indicate use of the
CLINT model with either non-vectored or vectored transfer to a handler
function, with the 4-byte aligned table base address held in the upper
bits of {tvec}.

NOTE: WARL means "Write Any, Read Legal" indicating that any value can
be attempted to be written but only supported values are retained.

NOTE: CLIC mode is enabled using previously reserved values (`*10` or
`*11`) in the low two bits of {tvec}.

=== CLIC versus PLIC

The standard RISC-V platform-level interrupt controller (PLIC)
provides centralized interrupt prioritization and routing for shared
platform-level interrupts, and sends only a single external interrupt
signal per privilege mode (`meip`/`seip`/`ueip`) to each hart.

The CLIC complements the PLIC.  Smaller single-core systems might have
only a CLIC, while multicore systems might have a CLIC per-core and a
single shared PLIC.  The PLIC ``**__m__**eip`` signals are treated as
hart-local interrupt sources by the CLIC at each core.

=== CLIC versus CLINT

The Core-Local Interrupt (CLINT) block was a small unit that provided
local interrupts on earlier designs, and managed the software, timer,
and external interrupt signals
(``**__m__**sip``/``**__m__**tip``/``**__m__**eip`` signals in
the {ip} register).  The CLINT also allowed additional custom
fast interrupt signals to be added in bits 16 and up of the
{ip} register.

New settings of {tvec} mode as described below are used to enable CLIC
modes instead of the original CLINT modes.  Platform profiles may
require either or both of the original CLINT and CLIC interrupt modes.

== CLIC Design

This section describes the design of the Core-Local Interrupt
Controller that receives interrupt signals and presents the next
interrupt to be processed to the processor.

=== CLIC Interrupt levels

The CLIC extends interrupt preemption to support up to 16 interrupt
levels for each privilege mode, where higher-numbered interrupt levels
can preempt lower-numbered interrupt levels.  Interrupt level 0
corresponds to regular execution outside of an interrupt handler.
Levels 1--15 correspond to interrupt handler levels. Usually systems
will support 2 (7,15), 4 (3,7,11,15), 8 (1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15), or 15
interrupt levels (1--15) in addition to level 0.  Platform profiles
will dictate how many interrupt levels must be supported.

Incoming interrupts with a higher interrupt level can preempt an
active interrupt handler running at a lower interrupt level in the
same privilege mode, provided interrupts are globally enabled in this
privilege mode.

NOTE: Existing RISC-V interrupt behavior is retained, where incoming
interrupts for a higher privilege mode can preempt an active interrupt
handler running in a lower privilege mode, regardless of global
interrupt enable in lower privilege mode.

=== CLIC Interrupt Input Configuration (`clicintcfg`)

The CLIC design supports up to 1,024 interrupt inputs per hart, with
each interrupt input _i_ having an 8-bit memory-mapped WARL
configuration register, `clicintcfg[__i__]`.

A fixed parameter of the CLIC (`CLICINTBITS`) is how many total bits
are present in the `clicintcfg` registers , with 2 {lt}
`CLICINTBITS` {lt} 8.  The implemented bits are kept left-justified
in the most-significant bits of each 8-bit `clicintcfg[__i__]`
register, with the lower unimplemented bits treated as hardwired to 1.
These configuration bits are interpreted as mode, level, and
priority depend on the setting of the `cliccfg` register as
described below.

Each interrupt input also has an orthogonal interrupt-enable bit
(`clicintie[i]`) as well as an interrupt-pending bit (`clicintip[i]`)
in the memory map.  For level-sensitive hardware interrupts, the
interrupt-pending bits are read-only.

The CLIC circuitry treats the `clicintcfg` values as unsigned
integers, and takes a global maximum across all pending-and-enabled
`clicintcfg` values to select the interrupt to present to the core.
The `cliccfg` setting then determines how to split the maximum
`clicintcfg` value into privilege mode (M/S/U), interrupt level
(0--15), and interrupt priority (0--255).

WARNING: Selecting an interrupt level of 0 for a high privilege mode
disables the interrupt, but can also masks any interrupt at a lower
privilege mode since the higher privilege mode causes the interrupt
signal to appear more urgent than any lower privilege mode interrupt.

NOTE: On a multithreaded core, the `clicintcfg[__i__]` register might
also contain a hart-id field to direct the interrupt to one hart on
the core.  This multithreaded option is not discussed further in this
proposal.

==== Interrupt Input Cause Codes

The 1024 CLIC interrupt vectors are given unique {cause} `exccode`
values.  The original CLINT interrupts retain their original cause
values, while the new interrupts are numbered starting at 16.

NOTE: When upgrading an earlier CLINT-based system design that had
local interrupts attached directly to bits 16 and above, these local
interrupts can be now attached as CLIC inputs 16 and above to retain
the same interrupt IDs.

=== CLIC configuration (`cliccfg`)

The CLIC has a single memory-mapped 6-bit global configuration
register, `cliccfg`, that defines how the `clicintcfg[__i__]`
registers are subdivided into mode, level, and priority fields, which
are held in descending order from the most-significant to the
least-significant bits of each `clicintcfg` register.  The lowest
variable bit in the `clicintcfg[__i__]` field can also be used to
control whether interrupt _i_ uses hardware vectoring.

The `cliccfg` register has three WARL fields, a 2-bit `nmbits` field, a 3-bit
`nlbits` field, and a 1-bit `nvbits` field described next.

==== Specifying interrupt privilege mode

NOTE: Figure out interaction with hypervisor mode.

The 2-bit `cliccfg.nmbits` WARL field encodes how many bits in a
`clicintcfg[__i__]` register are used to hold an input __i__'s
privilege mode.

M-mode-only systems do not support privilege-mode fields in the
`clicintcfg` registers (`cliccfg.nmbits` = 0).

M/U-mode systems with user-level interrupts support `cliccfg.nmbits` =
0 or 1.  If `cliccfg.nmbits` = 0, then all interrupts are treated as
M-mode interrupts.  If the `cliccfg.nmbits` = 1, then a value of 1 in
the MSB of an `clicintcfg[__i__]` register indicates that interrupt
intput is taken in M-mode, while a value of 0 indicates that interrupt
is taken in U-mode.

M/S/U-mode systems support 0, 1, or 2 bits of privilege-mode field.
`cliccfg.nmbits` = 0 indicates that all local interrupts are taken in
M-mode.  `cliccfg.nmbits` = 1 indicates that the MSB selects between M-mode
(1) and S-mode (0).  `cliccfg.nmbits` = 2 indicates that the two MSBs of
each `clicintcfg[__i__]` register encode the interrupt's privilege mode using the
same encoding as the `mstatus.mpp` field.

----

   M/S/U      3     xxxxxxxx     Reserved
----

==== Specifying interrupt level

The 3-bit `cliccfg.nlbits` WARL field indicates how many bits
immediately below the `cliccfg.nmbits` privilege-mode bits encode the
level at which the interrupt is taken.  Valid values are 0--4.

If the `nmbits + nlbits` {gt} `CLICINTBITS`, then the lower bits of
the 4-bit interrupt level are assumed to be all 1s.  If `nlbits` {lt}
4, then the lower bits of the 4-bit interrupt level are assumed to be
all 1s.  The following table shows how levels are encoded in either of
these two cases.

----
 #bits   encoding           interrupt levels
     1    x111                 7,                   15
     2    xx11         3,      7,       11,         15
     3    xxx1     1,  3,  5,  7,  9,   11,   13,   15
     4    xxxx     1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15

 x bits are available variable bits in level specification
----

If `nlbits` = 0, then all interrupts are treated as level 15.

Examples of `cliccfg` settings:

 CLICINTBITS nmbits nlbits clicintcfg[i] interrupt levels
       2      2       2      mm000000     15
       3      2       2      mml00000     7,15
       4      2       2      mmll0000     3,7,11,15
       5      2       3      mmlll000     1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15
       5      1       1      mlppp000     7,15

==== Specifying interrupt priority

The least-significant bits in `clicintcfg[__i__]` that are not
configured to be part of the mode or level are used to prioritize
among interrupts pending-and-enabled at the same privilege mode and
interrupt level. The highest-priority interrupt at a given privilege
mode and interrupt level is taken first.  In case there are multiple
pending-and-enabled interrupts at the same highest priority, the
lowest-numbered interrupt is taken first.

Any implemented priority bits are treated as the most-significant bits
of a 8-bit unsigned integer with lower unimplemented bits set to 1.
For example, with one priority bit (`p111_1111`), interrupts can be
set to have priorities 127 or 255, and with two priority bits
(`pp11_1111`), interrupts can be set to have priorities 63, 127, 191,
or 255.

==== Specifying selective interrupt hardware vectoring

The single-bit WARL `nvbits` field in `cliccfg` enables or disables
selective interrupt hardware vectoring.

If `nvbits` = 0, then selective interrupt vectoring is turned off, and
all interrupts are vectored according to the mode setting held in the
low bits of {tvec}.  The {tvec} register is used to specify the
handler PC for non-vectored mode, and to specify the table base
address for hardware vectored mode.  A separate {tvt} CSR is provided
to support software vectored mode, and selective input vectoring.

If `nvbits` = 1, then selective interrupt vectoring is turned on.  The
least-significant implemented bit of `clicintcfg[__i__]` (i.e.,
`clicinfcfg[__i__][8-CLICINTBITS]`) controls the vectoring behavior of
interrupt _i_.  If the relevant bit of `clicintcfg[__i__]` is 0, then
behavior follows the default specified by {tvec}.  If the relevant bit
of `clicintcfg[__i__]` is 1, then the interrupt is hardware vectored
independent of the settings of {tvec}.  This allows some interrupts to
all jump to a common base address held in {tvec}, while the others are
vectored in hardware via a table pointed to by the additional {tvt}
CSR.

NOTE: Selective hardware vectoring is intended to be used with the
non-vectored CLIC mode.

NOTE: We could alternatively have `clicintcfg[__i__][8-CLICINTBITS]`
invert the vectoring setting for input _i_.

NOTE: The setting of `nvbits` does not alter the way in which the
implemented `clicintcfg[__i__]` bits are interpreted as mode, level,
or priority.  The encoding means that selectively hardware-vectored
interrupts are always handled before non-hardware-vectored interrupts
with identical settings in the other upper bits of
`clicintcfg[__i__]`.  The assumption is that this is usually the
desired behavior.  Additional `cliccfg` bits could specify different
treatment of the hardware vectoring bits (e.g., ignoring the vectoring
bit in priority calculation, or inverting the encoding to handle
non-vectored before vectored).

Examples:

 CLICINTBITS nmbits nlbits nvbits clicintcfg[i] Vectored?
       2      2       2      1    mm000000      M/S-mode interrupts
       3      2       2      1    mml00000      Level 15
       4      2       2      1    mmll0000      Levels 7, 15
       5      2       3      1    mmlll000      Levels 3,7,11,15
       5      1       1      1    mlppp000      Priorities 63,127,191,255

=== CLIC interaction with other local interrupts

The CLIC subsumes the functionality of the fast local interrupts
previously provided in bits 16 and up of {ip}/{ie}, so these are no
longer visible in {ip}/{ie}.

The existing timer (`mtip`/`stip`/`etip`), software
(`msip`/`ssip`/`esip`), and external interrupt inputs
(`meip`/`seip`/`ueip`) are treated as additional local interrupt
sources, where the privilege mode is hardwired but the interrupt level
and priority can be altered using memory-mapped `clicintcfg[__i__]` registers.  For each
of meip/mtip/msip/seip/stip/ssip/ueip/utip/usip, an 8-bit 
configuration register is provided, which follows the format of the
above.

== CLIC CSRs

This section describes the CLIC-related hart-specific CSRs.

The interrupt-handling CSRs are listed below, with changes and
additions for CLIC mode described in the following sections.

[source]

       0xm00   mstatus      Status register

 (NEW) 0xm49   mscratcho    Conditional stack swap on handler exit

         m is the nibble encoding the privilege mode (M=0x3, S=0x1, U=0x0)
----

=== Changes to {status} CSRs

Operation of {status} is unchanged, except that the ``**__m__**pp``
and ``**__m__**pie`` in {status} are now accessble via the {cause}
register.

=== Changes to Delegation ({edeleg}/{ideleg}) CSRs

The CLIC input configuration `clcintcfg[__i__]` specifies the
privilege mode in which each interrupt should be taken, so the
`mideleg` CSR ceases to have effect in CLIC mode.

Exception delegation specified by `medeleg` continues to function as
before.

=== Changes to {ie}/{ip} CSRs

The {ie} CSR is hardwired to zero in CLIC mode, replaced by separate
memory-mapped interrupt enables (`clicintie[__i__]`).

The {ip} CSR is hardware to zero in CLIC mode, replaced by separate
memory-mapped interrupt enables (`clicintip[__i__]`).

=== New {tvec} CSR modes

The new interrupt handling modes are encoded as new states in the
existing {tvec} WARL register, where the low two bits of {tvec} are
`10` or `11`.  In these modes, the trap vector base address held in
{tvec} is constrained to be aligned on a 64-byte boundary.

----
 mtvec   Action on Interrupt
 aaaa00  pc := OBASE                (original non-vectored CLINT mode)
 aaaa01  pc := OBASE + 4 * exccode      (original vectored CLINT mode)
 000010  pc := NBASE                          (non-vectored CLIC mode)
 000011  pc := M[TBASE + XLEN/8 * exccode)] & ~1  (vectored CLIC mode)
 xxxx1?  (xxxx!=0000)                            Reserved

 OBASE = mtvec[XLEN-1:2]<<2 # Original vector base was 4-byte aligned.
 NBASE = mtvec[XLEN-1:6]<<6 # New vector base is 64-byte aligned.
 TBASE = mtvt[XLEN-1:6]<<6  # Trap vector table base is 64-byte aligned.
----

Writing a value to {tvec} with the low two bits `10` selects a
non-vectored CLIC mode, where the processor jumps to the
64-byte-aligned trap handler address held in the upper XLEN-6 bits of
{tvec} for all exceptions and interrupts in privilege mode
`**__m__**`.

Writing a value to {tvec} with the low two bits `11` selects vectored
CLIC mode.  In vectored CLIC mode, on an interrupt, the processor
switches to the handler's privilege mode and sets the hardware
vectoring bit {inhv} in {cause}, then fetches an XLEN-bit handler
address from the in-memory table whose base address (TBASE) is in
{tvt}.  The trap handler function address is fetched from
`TBASE+XLEN/8*exccode`.  If the fetch is successful, the processor
clears the low bit of the handler address, sets the PC to this handler
address, then clears the {inhv} bit in {cause}.  The overall effect
is:

     pc := M[TBASE + XLEN/8 * exccode] & ~1

[source]
----
           # Vector table layout for RV32 (4-byte function pointers)
  mtvt ->  0x800000 # Interrupt 0 handler function pointer
           0x800004 # Interrupt 1 handler function pointer
           0x800008 # Interrupt 2 handler function pointer
           0x80000c # Interrupt 3 handler function pointer

           # Vector table layout for RV64 (8-byte function pointers)
  mtvt ->  0x800000 # Interrupt 0 handler function pointer
           0x800008 # Interrupt 1 handler function pointer
           0x800010 # Interrupt 2 handler function pointer
           0x800018 # Interrupt 3 handler function pointer
----

NOTE: The original CLINT vectored mode simply jumped to an address in
the trap vector table, while the new CLIC vectored mode reads a
handler function address from the table, and jumps to it in hardware.

NOTE: This version of the proposal has dropped the previously proposed
instruction encoding for the trap handler vector addresses, as it
complicated static initialization in C.  The entries in the table are
simple XLEN-bit function pointers.

NOTE: The hardware vectoring bit {inhv} is provided to allow resumable
traps on fetches to the trap vector table.

Implementations might support only one of CLINT or CLIC mode.  If only
CLINT mode is supported, writes to bit 1 are ignored and it’s always
set to zero (current behavior).  If only CLIC mode is supported,
writes to bit 1 are also ignored and it’s always set to one.  CLIC
mode writes zero bits 2-5 (assuming no further CLIC extensions are
supported).

For permissions-checking purposes, the memory access to retrieve the
function pointer for vectoring is treated as a load with the privilege
mode of the interrupt handler.  If there is an access exception on the
table load, {epc} holds the faulting address.  If this was a page
fault, the table load can be resumed by returning with {epc} pointing
to the table entry and the trap handler mode bit set.

Instruction fetch at the handler address might cause misaligned or
access exceptions, which are reported with {epc} containing the
faulting instruction fetch address.

In both vectored and non-vectored CLIC mode, synchronous exception
traps always jump to NBASE.

=== New {tvt} CSR

The {tvt} WARL XLEN-bit CSR holds the base address of the trap vector
table, aligned on a 64-byte boundary.  Values other than 0 in the low
6 bits of {tvt} are reserved.

NOTE: A previous proposal used positive and negative offsets from
{tvec} to point at the shared trampoline code and the trap vector
table respectively, but this imposed a hard constraint on memory
layout, which would be problematic when the trampoline code would
prefer to be in flash/ROM while the writable vector table should be in
SRAM. The {tvt} CSR allows the trampoline code and the trap vector
table to be independently located in the system memory map.

=== Changes to {epc} CSRs

The {epc} CSRs behave as before, capturing the PC at which execution
was interrupted.

=== Changes to {cause} CSRs

In both CLINT and CLIC mode, the {cause} CSR is written at the time an
interrupt or synchronous trap is taken, recording the reason for the
interrupt or trap.  For CLIC mode, {cause} is also extended to record
more information about the interrupted context, which is used to
reduce the overhead to save and restore that context for an {ret}
instruction. CLIC mode {cause} also adds state to record progress
through the trap handling process.

 mcause
 Bits    Field      Description
 XLEN-1 Interrupt  Interrupt=1, Exception=0
    30  minhv      Hardware vectoring in progress when set
 29:28  mpp        Previous privilege mode, same as mstatus.mpp

    23  mpie       Previous interrupt enable, same as mstatus.mpie
   9:0  Exccode    Exception/interrupt code

The `mcause.mpp` and `mcause.mpie` fields mirror the `mstatus.mpp` and
`mstatus.mpie` fields, and are aliased into `mcause` to reduce context
save/restore code.

If the hart is currently running at some privilege mode (`pp`) at some
interrupt level (`pil`) and an enabled interrupt becomes pending at
any interrupt level in a higher privilege mode or if an interrupt at a
higher interrupt level in the current privilege mode becomes pending
and interrupts are globally enabled in this privilege mode, then
execution is immediately transferred to a handler running with the new
interrupt's privilege mode (`**__m__**`) and interrupt level (`il`).

The CSR {epc} is set to the PC of the interrupted application
code or preempted interrupt handler, while the {cause}
register now captures the previous privilege mode (`pp`), interrupt
level (`pil`) and interrupt enable (`pie`), as well as the id of the
interrupt in `exccode`.

The supervisor `scause` register has only a single `spp` bit (to
indicate user/supervisor) mirrored from `sstatus.spp`, while the user
`ucause` register has no `upp` bit as interrupts can only have come
from user mode.

=== New Handler Address and Interrupt-Enable CSR ({nxti})

The {nxti} CSR can be used by software to service the next horizontal
interrupt for the same privilege mode when it has greater level than
the saved interrupt context (held in {cause}`.pil`, without incuring
the full cost of an interrupt pipeline flush and context save/restore.
The {nxti} CSR is designed to be accessed using CSRRSI/CSRRCI
instructions, where the value read is a pointer to an entry in the
trap handler table and the write back updates the interrupt-enable
status. In addition, accesses to the {nxti} have side-effects that
update the interrupt context state.

NOTE: This is different than a regular CSR instruction as the value
returned is different from the value used in the read-modify-write
operation.

A read of the {nxti} CSR returns either zero, indicating there is no
suitable interrupt to service or that the highest ranked interrupt is
selectively hardware vectored, or returns the address of the entry in
the trap handler table for software trap vectoring.

If the CSR instruction that acccesses {nxti} includes a write, the
{status} CSR is the one used for the read-modify-write portion of the
operation, while the {cause} register's `exccode` field and the
{intstatus} register's `**__m__**il` field can also be updated with
the new interrupt level.

NOTE: If the CSR instruction does not include write side effects
(e.g., `csrr t0, mnxti`), then no state update on any CSR occurs.

The {nxti} CSR is intended to be used inside an interrupt handler
after an initial interrupt has been taken and {cause} and {epc}
registers updated with the interrupted context and the id of the
interrupt.

[source]
--
 // Pseudo-code for csrrsi rd, mnxti, uimm[4:0] in M mode.
 mstatus |= uimm[4:0]; // Performed regardless of interrupt readiness.
 if (clic.priv==M && clic.level > mcause.pil
     && (cliccfg.nvbits==0 || clicintcfg[clic.id][8-CLICINTBITS]==0) ) {
   // The CLIC interrupt should be serviced before returning to the saved context,
   // unless it's a selectively vectored interupt.
   minstatus.mil = clic.level; // Update hart's interrupt level.
   mcause.exccode = clic.id;   // Update interrupt id.
   rd = TBASE + XLEN/8 * clic.id; // Return pointer to trap handler entry.
 } else {
   // No interrupt or a selectively vectored interrupt.
   rd = 0;
 }
--

NOTE: Vertical interrupts to different privilege modes will be taken
preemptively by the hardware, so {nxti} effectively only ever handles
the next interrupt in the same privilege mode.

=== New Interrupt status ({intstatus}) CSR

A new M-mode CSR, `mintstatus`, holds the active interrupt level for
each supported privilege mode.  These fields are read-only.  The
primary reason to expose these fields is to support debug.

 mintstatus fields
 15:12 mil
 11: 8 Reserved # To follow pattern of others.
  7: 4 sil
  3: 0 uil

Corresponding supervisor mode, `sintstatus`, and user, `uintstatus`,
provide restricted views of mintstatus.

== CLIC Interrupt Operation

This section describes the operation of CLIC interrupts.

=== General interrupt overview

At any time, a hart is running in some privilege mode with some
interrupt level.  The hart's privilege mode is held internally in the
processor but is not visible to software running on a hart (to avoid
virtualization holes), but the current interrupt level is made visible
in the {intstatus} register.  Interrupt level 0 corresponds to regular
execution outside of an interrupt handler.

Within a privilege mode `*_m_*`, if the associated global
interrupt-enable {ie} is clear, then no interrupts will be taken in
that privilege mode, but a pending-enabled interrupt in a higher
privilege mode will preempt current execution.  If {ie} is set, then
pending-enabled interrupts at a higher interrupt level in the same
privilege mode will preempt current execution and run the interrupt
handler for the higher interrupt level.

As with the existing RISC-V mechanism, when an interrupt or
synchronous exception is taken, the privilege mode and interrupt level
are modified to reflect the new privilege mode and interrupt level.
The global interrupt-enable bit of the handler's privilege mode is
cleared, to prevent preemption by higher-level interrupts in the same
privilege mode.

The overall behavior is summarized in the following table: the Current
`p/ie/il` fields represent the current privilege mode `P` (not
software visible), interrupt enable in {status} `ie` and interrupt
level `L` in {intstatus}; the CLIC `priv`,`level`, and `id` fields
represent the highest-ranked interrupt currently present in the CLIC
with `nP` representing the new privilege mode, `nL` representing the
new interrupt level, and `id` representing the interrupt's id;
Current' shows the `p/ie/il` context in the handler's privilege mode;
`pc` represents the program counter with `V` representing the result
of any hardware vectoring; `cde` represents the {cause} `exccode`
field; while the Previous `pp/il/ie/epc` columns represent previous
context fields in {cause} and {epc}.

 Current  |      CLIC          |->      Current'          Previous
 p/ie/il  | priv level   id    |->    p/ie/il  pc  cde   pp/il/ie epc
 P  ?  ?  | nP<P     ?      ?  |->    - -  -   -   -     -  -  -  -      # Interrupt ignored
 P  0  ?  | nP=P     ?      ?  |->    - -  -   -   -     -  -  -  -      # Interrupts disabled
 P  1  ?  | nP=P     0      ?  |->    - -  -   -   -     -  -  -  -      # No interrupt
 P  1  L  | nP=P   0<nL<=L  ?  |->    - -  -   -   -     -  -  -  -      # Interrupt ignored
 P  1  L  | nP=P   L<nL    id  |->    P 0  nL  V   id    P  L  1  pc     # Horizontal interrupt taken
 P  ?  ?  | nP>P     0      ?  |->    - -  -   -   -     -  -  -  -      # No interrupt
 P  e  L  | nP>P   0<nL    id  |->   nP 0  nL  V   id    P  L  e  pc     # Vertical interrupt taken

=== Critical Sections in Interrupt Handlers

To implement a critical section between interrupt handlers at
different levels in the same privilege mode, an interrupt handler at
any interrupt level can clear the mode's global interrupt-enable bit,
{ie}, to prevent any interrupts with the same privilege mode from
being taken.

NOTE: Need to specify a way to set an interrupt-level threshold, to
more selectively disable preemption.

=== Synchronous Exception Handling

Horizontal synchronous exception traps, which stay within a privilege
mode, are serviced with the same interrupt level as the instruction
that raised the exception.

WARNING: The synchronous trap will overwrite the {epc} and {cause}
values, so exceptions causing horizontal traps should generally be
avoided in interrupt handlers.

Vertical synchronous exception traps, which are serviced at a higher
privilege mode, are taken at interrupt level 0 in the higher privilege
mode.

WARNING: Vertical synchronous trap handlers should avoid causing
horizontal traps, as these will overwrite {epc} and {cause}.

=== Returns from Handlers

The regular {ret} instructions are used to return from handlers in
privilege mode `*_m_*`.  Execution continues at the saved privilege
mode `**__m__**cause.**__m__**pp`, at PC {epc}, with interrupt level
`**__m__**cause.**__m__**pil`, and with the global interrupt enable
for the restored mode as `**__m__**cause.**__m__**pie`.

== Interrupt Handling Software

=== Interrupt Stack Software Conventions

The CLIC supports multiple nested interrupt handlers, and each handler
requires some working registers. To make registers available, each
handler typically saves and restores registers from the interrupted
context on a memory-resident stack.  In addition, the memory-resident
stack is used to hold other interrupted context information, such as
{epc} and {cause}, which are required by the {ret} instruction.

The standard RISC-V ABI convention is that stacks grow downwards, and
that memory addresses below the current stack pointer can be
dynamically altered by another agent, such as an interrupt handler.

When interrupts are taken horizontally within the same privilege mode,
the interrupt handler may be able to use the same stack as the
interrupted thread, by allocating a new stack frame below the current
stack pointer.

When interrupts are taken vertically into a higher privilege mode, the
stack pointer must be swapped to a stack within the higher privilege
mode.  The {scratch} registers can be used to hold the stack pointer
of a higher privilege mode while lower privilege code is executing, or
{scratch} can be used to point to more extensive thread-local context
that might contain a stack pointer.

=== Inline interrupt handlers and "interrupt attribute" for C

Inline interrupt handlers are small leaf functions that handle simple
interrupts.  To provide easy C coding for inline interrupt handlers,
while reducing register save/restore overhead, we use standard
interrupt attributes, which have the following syntax:

  /* Small ISR to poke device to clear interrupt and increment in-memory counter. */
  void __attribute__ ((interrupt))
  foo (void)
  {
    extern volatile int INTERRUPT_FLAG;
    INTERRUPT_FLAG = 0;
    extern volatile int COUNTER;
  #ifdef __riscv_atomic
    __atomic_fetch_add (&COUNTER, 1, __ATOMIC_RELAXED);
  #else
    COUNTER++;
  #endif
  }

The attribute tells the C compiler to use callee-save for all
registers, so the handler has to "pay as it goes" to use registers,
and only save the full caller-save set if it makes a nested regular C
call.  The attribute also tells the C compiler to align the function
entry point on an 8-byte boundary.

   .align 3
   foo:
      addi sp, sp, -FRAMESIZE      # Create a frame on stack.
      sw s0, offset(sp)            # Save working register.
      sw x0, INTERRUPT_FLAG, s0    # Clear interrupt flag.
      sw s1, offset(sp)            # Save working register.
      la s0, COUNTER               # Get counter address.
      li s1, 1
      amoadd.w x0, (s0), s1        # Increment counter in memory.
      lw s1, offset(sp)            # Restore registers.
      lw s0, offset(sp)
      addi sp, sp, FRAMESIZE       # Free stack frame.
      mret                         # Return from handler using saved mepc.

With hardware vectoring, inline interrupt handlers can provide very
rapid response for small tasks.

NOTE: The above entire handler executes in 13 instructions.  The
`INTERRUPT_FLAG` store and the `la` require two instructions each to
build up a global address.  A simple pipeline would encounter two
pipeline flushes (on entry and on exit), plus the cycles taken to fetch
the hardware vector entry.

These inline handlers can be used with the original CLINT design as
well as the new CLIC design.

To take advantage of hardware preemption in the new CLIC design,
inline handlers must save and restore {epc} and {cause} before
enabling interrupts:

   .align 3
   foo:
      #----- Interrupts disabled on entry ---#
      addi sp, sp, -FRAMESIZE      # Create a frame on stack.
      sw s0, offset(sp)            # Save working register.
      sw s1, offset(sp)            # Save working register.
      csrr s0, mcause              # Read cause.
      csrr s1, mepc                # Read epc.
      csrrsi x0, mstatus, MIE      # Enable interrupts.
      #----- Interrupts enabled ---------#
      sw s0, offset(sp)            # Save cause on stack.
      sw x0, INTERRUPT_FLAG, s0    # Clear interrupt flag.
      sw s1, offset(sp)            # Save epc on stack.
      la s0, COUNTER               # Get counter address.
      li s1, 1
      amoadd.w x0, (s0), s1        # Increment counter in memory.
      lw s1, offset(sp)            # Restore epc
      lw s0, offset(sp)            # Restore cause
      #----- Interrupts disabled  ---------#
      csrrci x0, mstatus, MIE      # Disable interrupts.
      csrw mepc, s1                # Put epc back.
      csrw mcause, s0              # Put cause back.
      lw s1, offset(sp)            # Restore s1.
      lw s0, offset(sp)            # Restore s0.
      addi sp, sp, FRAMESIZE       # Free stack frame.
      mret                         # Return from handler.
      #------------------------------------#

NOTE: This version requires 10 more instructions, but reduces the time
a preempting interrupt has to wait from a 13-instruction window to a
6-instruction window (the instruction that disables interrupts can be
preempted before committing).

WARNING: This form cannot be used with the existing CLINT scheme,
unless the original interrupt pending signal is cleared before
re-enabling interrupts.

=== Calling C ABI functions as Interrupt Handlers

An alternative model is where all interrupt handler routines use the
standard C ABI.  In this case, the CLIC would use no hardware
vectoring with a common software trampoline, and use the {nxti}
instruction to obtain the trap-handler address.

=== Revised ABI for Embedded RISC-V

The overhead to save and restore registers in the interrupt trampoline
can be reduced with a new embedded ABI that reduces the number of
caller-save registers.  Work is underway to define such an ABI, but it
is likely to require around 7 integer registers to be saved/restored
instead of 16 in the standard Unix ABI.

This will result in 18 instructions executed in the trampoline code
before arriving at the correct handler function, of which 9 are stores
(saving 7 registers plus 2 words for {epc} and {cause}).

== CLIC Interrupt IDs

The original CLINT interrupts retain their interrupt ID in CLIC mode.
The `cliccfgint` settings are now used to delegate these interrupts as
required.

An additional CLIC software interrupt bit (csip) is provided.  This is
generally available for software use, but is usually used for the
local background interrupt thread.

CLIC interrupt inputs are allocated IDs beginning at interrupt ID 16.
Any fast local interrupts that would have been connected at interrupt
ID 16 and above should now be mapped into corresponding inputs of the
CLIC.

== CLIC memory map

=== CLIC/CLINT shared memory map

The CLIC reuses the CLINT memory map for the `msip`, `mtimecmp`, and
`mtime` memory-mapped registers.  This simplifies providing both CLINT
and CLIC mode in the same hardware.  The CLIC/CLINT memory map is
given relative to a local interrupt base address (in SiFive Freedom
platforms, the local interrupt base address is `0x0200_0000`).

=== M-Mode CLIC regions

Each hart has a separate CLIC accessed by a separate address region.
The following is the memory map of the 4KiB memory region designed to
support M-mode access.  Where a system has PMP, this region must be
made accessible to the M-mode software running on the hart.

----

0xc00     1B          RW            cliccfg

clicintip[i] is read-only for level-based interrupts and read-write
for edge-triggered interrupts. 
----

NOTE: The `clicintip[__i__]` region is placed first as this is the
only region usually written in interrupt handlers to clear down
edge-triggered interrupt signal bits.  The CLIC base address, which
also corresponds to the start of the `clicintip` array, can be loaded
with a single `lui` instruction to reduce instruction count in
handlers that have to calculate the appropriate `clicintip[__i__]`
address.

In systems that support additional privilege modes on a hart, an
additional memory region is defined for each privilege mode that
provides a restricted view of the CLIC's state.

=== S-Mode CLIC regions for M/S/U harts

Supervisor-mode CLIC regions only expose interrupts that have been
configured to be supervisor-accessible via the M-mode CLIC region.
System software must configure virtual memory and PMP permissions to
only allow access to this region from appropriate supervisor-mode
code.

[source]

0x800+i   1B/input    RW            clicintcfg[i]
----

Any interrupt _i_ that is not accessible to S-mode appears as
hard-wired zeros in `clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, and
`clicintcfg[__i__]`.

Where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 0, all interrupts are M-mode only, and all
are inaccessible to S-mode.

Where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 1, if `clicintcfg[__i__]` is set to S-mode
(bit 7 is clear), interrupt _i_ is visible in the S-mode region except
that only the low 7 bits of `clicintcfg[__i__]` can be written via the
S-mode memory region.

Where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 2, if bit 7 of `clicintcfg[__i__]` is clear
(S-mode or U-mode), interrupt _i_ is visible through the S-mode region
except that only the low 7 bits of `clicintcfg[__i__]` can be written
via the S-mode memory region.  This allows the supervisor region to be
used to selectively configure the interrupt as S-mode or U-mode.

=== U-Mode CLIC regions in M/U harts or M/S/U harts

User-mode CLIC regions only expose interrupts that have been
configured to be user-accessible via the M-mode CLIC region.  System
software must configure virtual memory and PMP permissions to only
allow access to this region from appropriate user-mode code.

----

Any interrupt _i_ that is not accessible to U-mode appears as
hard-wired zeros in `clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, and
`clicintcfg[__i__]`.

Where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 0, all interrupts are M-mode only, and all
are inaccessible to U-mode.

In M/U-only harts, where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 1, if `clicintcfg[__i__]`
is set to U-mode (bit 7 is clear), then interrupt _i_ is visible in the
U-mode region except that only the low 7 bits of `clicintcfg[__i__]`
can be written via the U-mode memory region.

In M/S/U harts, if `cliccfg.nmbits`{lt} 2 then all interrupts are
either M-mode or S-mode, and all are inaccessible to U-mode.

In M/S/U harts, where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 2, if `clicintcfg[__i__]` is
set to U-mode (bits 6 and 7 are clear), then interrupt _i_ is visible
in the U-mode region except that only the low 6 bits of
`clicintcfg[__i__]` can be written via the U-mode memory region.

=== CLIC memory map for Multiple Harts

In a system with multiple harts, the M-mode CLIC regions for all the harts are
placed contiguously in the memory space.

NOTE: CLIC regions can be made accessible to other harts to support
additional inter-processor interrupts via writes to
`clicintip[__i__]`.

If the system supports supervisor-mode and user-mode interrupts, the
corresponding CLIC memory regions are laid out following the M-mode
CLIC regions.

 U-CLIC-base = S-region[maxHartID+1]
 U-region[h] = U-CLIC-base + 4096*h # U-region for hart h.

 If no harts have supervisor mode, then U-CLIC-base = M-region[nHarts]
----

For systems with non-contiguous hart ID or harts containing different
combinations of supported privilege modes, the maximum hart ID is used
to space apart CLIC memory regions to simplify address calculations
based on hart ID.  Any CLIC memory regions corresponding to
unsupported privilege modes on a hart, or non-existent harts where
harts are not contiguously numbered, are hardwired to zero.

== CLIC and PCI Message-Signalled Interrupts (MSI)

NOTE: This is a proposed future extension.

PCI MSIs contain an interrupt number in the data portion of a memory
store.  The CLIC will be extended to add another address to which PCI
MSIs can be directed.  A MSI store to that address will set the
`clicintip[__i__]` bit corresponding to the MSI data value.  The CLIC
PCI address will reside in the same `0xc00` region as the `cliccfg`
field, and will also be made available in S-mode and U-mode regions to
allow MSIs to be restricted to S-mode and U-mode interrupt inputs
respectively.

== Managing Interrupt Stack Pointers Across Privilege Modes

Interrupt handlers need to have a place to spill the previous
context's state to provide working registers for the handler code.
The RISC-V ABI allows addresses immediately below the stack pointer to
be overwritten by interrupt service routines.

=== Stack Swap CSR State

To prevent security holes, each privilege mode can only use it's own
stack to save and restore interrupted context's state.  If a handler
can be entered from a different privilege mode, the correct stack
pointer must be swapped in at entry to the handler, with the
convention that each mode `*_m_*`'s stack pointer is held in {scratch}
while executing in a lower-privilege mode.  Because handlers can be
preempted between any two instructions, some additional architectural
state and instructions are required to implement stack swapping
correctly.

The new state includes two fields per privilege mode on systems with
more than one privilege mode.  These read/write fields live in the
upper 16 bits of the {intstatus} registers.

[source]
----
 mintstatus
  31:28 mspl[3:0] // M stack pointer level
  27:24 reserved  // To follow pattern of others.
  23:20 sspl[3:0] // S stack pointer level
     19 msps      // M stack pointer swapped?
     18 reserved
     17 ssps      // S stack pointer swapped?
     16 reserved

 sintstatus
  23:20 sspl[3:0]
     17 ssps

 uintstatus
 // Doesn't exist as interrupts always taken on same stack.
----

The single-bit {sps} field indicates if a handler in mode `*_m_*` has
swapped in the mode's stack pointer.  The 4-bit {spl} fields holds the
interrupt level of the handler that successfully swapped in the
privilege mode's stack pointer to current `sp`.

=== Stack Swap CSR instructions ({scratchi}/{scratcho})

New instructions are provided to conditionally swap into the stack
pointer when entering a higher-privilege mode, encoded as CSRRW
instructions to two special CSR registers per privilege mode.

On entry to a handler, before decrementing the stack pointer:

[source]
----
  csrrw rd, mscratchi, rs1

  // Pseudocode operation.
  if (mintstatus.msps==0) then {
      t = rs1; rd = mscratch; mscratch = t;
      mintstatus.msps = 1; mintstatus.mspl = mintstatus.mil;
  } else {
      rd = rs1;
  }

  // Usual use: csrrw sp, mscratchi, sp 
----

The instruction is defined to always copy a result (`rs1` or
`mscratch`) to the destination to simplify implementations using
register renaming, and in normal use has both `rs1` = `sp` and `rd` =
`sp`.

On exit from a handler, after incrementing the stack pointer:

[source]
----
  csrrw rd, mscratcho, rs1

  // Pseudocode operation.
  if (mintstatus.mspl == mintstatus.mil) then {
     t = rs1; rd = mscratch; mscratch = t;
     mintstatus.msps = 0;
  }
  else {
    rd = rs1;
  }

  // Usual use: csrrw sp, mscratcho, sp 
----

The two shadows of {scratch}, {scratchi} and {scratcho}, are used to
encode this new instruction behavior.

== Safe execution of urgent interrupts in lower-privileged modes

In some case it is desirable to preempt a higher-privilege mode to
execute time-critical interrupts in a lower-privilege mode.  These
cases are handled by registering an interrupt handler trampoline in
the higher privilege mode at the appropriate interrupt level which
then sets up a call to the user-level interrupt code.

The higher-privilege trampoline code has to perform the following
operations:

- save entire higher-privilege context state
- clear entire context state
- ensure "trap on lower-privilege RET instruction"  is set
- set timeout timer
- redirect to lower-privilege handler
- lower-privilege handler runs, and either exits with a RET that
  causes a trap, or timeout timer interrupt
- restore entire higher-privilege context state

The {status} register already contains a `TSR` bit to trap on
supervisor return.  An additional `TUR` bit in {status} would allowing
trapping user-level URET instructions to support such interrupts.

A complication is that the user-level interrupt handler might be
preempted by another user-level handler at a higher interrupt level,
which will execute URET but for a different context than that intiated
by the higher-privilege mode.  This problem can be avoided by always
running the urgent lower-privilege handlers at the highest interrupt
level in the the lower-privilege mode.

== Extension for Hardware stacked {epc}/{cause} Registers

WARNING: This section is out of date, and possibly obsolete.

Each interrupt level, l, for privilege mode, m, adds additional
[m]epc[l] and [m]cause[l] CSRs (e.g., mepc1/mcause1, mepc2/mcause2) to
hold the nested interrupted context.

The existing [m]epc/[m]cause CSRs are now modified to read and write
the epc and cause of the current interrupt level (e.g., mepc now
references mepc[mil]), so that an interrupt handler can be moved to a
different interrupt level without recompiling the software.

If the hart is currently running at some privilege mode (prev_mode) at
some interrupt level (prev_il) and an enabled interrupt becomes
pending at any interrupt level in a higher privilege mode or if an
enabled interrupt at a higher interrupt level in the current privilege
mode becomes pending, then execution is immediately transferred to a
handler running with the new interrupt's privilege mode (new_mode) and
interrupt level (new_il).  The CSR [new_mode]epc[new_il] is set to the
pc of the interrupted application code or preempted interrupt handler,
while the [new_mode]cause[new_il] register now captures the previous
privilege mode, interrupt level and interrupt enable, as well as the
id of the interrupt.  The interrupted level (prev_il) is held in bits
26-24 of [new_mode]cause[new_il].

The mpp/mpil/mpie, spp/spil/spie, and upp/upil/upie bits in the
mcause/scause/ucause registers take over the function of the privilege
and global interrupt-enable stack bits in mstatus/sstatus/ustatus.
For backwards compatibility, in M-mode, the mpp[1:0] field in mstatus
now accesses mcause[mil].ppm, and the mie bit now references
mcause[mil].pie.  The mstatus.spp bit now accesses scause[sil].spp,
and the mstatus.spie bit now accesses scause[sil].spie.  The
mstatus.upie bit now accesses ucause[uil].upie.
