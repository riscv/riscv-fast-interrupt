== Background and Motivation

The Core-Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC) is designed to provide
low-latency, vectored, pre-emptive
interrupts for RISC-V systems.  When activated the CLIC subsumes and
replaces the original RISC-V basic local interrupt scheme.  The CLIC
has a base design that requires minimal hardware, but supports
additional extensions to provide hardware acceleration.  The goal of
the CLIC is to provide support for a variety of software ABI
and interrupt models, without complex hardware that can impact
high-performance processor implementations.

The CLIC also supports a new Selective Hardware Vectoring feature that
allow users to optimize each interrupt for either faster response or
smaller code size.

NOTE: While the current CLIC provides only hart-local interrupt
control, future additions might also support directing interrupts to
harts within a core, hence the name (also CLIC sounds better than HLIC
or HIC).

=== Existing RISC-V Interrupts

The existing RISC-V interrupt system already supports interrupt
preemption, but only based on privilege mode.  At any point in time, a
RISC-V hart is running with a current privilege mode.  The global
interrupt enable bits, MIE/SIE/UIE, held in the
`mstatus`/`sstatus`/`ustatus` registers respectively, control whether
interrupts can be taken for the current or higher privilege modes;
interrupts are always disabled for lower-privileged modes.  Any
enabled interrupt from a higher-privilege mode will stop execution at
the current privilege mode, and enter the handler at the higher
privilege mode.  Each privilege mode has its own interrupt state
registers (`mepc`/`mcause` for M-mode, `sepc`/`scause` for S-mode,
`uepc`/`ucause` for U-mode) to support preemption, or
generically {epc} for privilege mode ``*_x_*``.  Preemption by a
higher-privilege-mode interrupt also pushes current privilege mode and
interrupt enable status onto the {pp} and {pie}
stacks in the {status} register of the higher-privilege mode.

The {tvec} register specifies both the interrupt mode and the base
address of the interrupt vector table.  The low bits of the WARL
{tvec} register indicate what interrupt model is supported.  The
original settings of {tvec} mode (`*00` and `*01`) indicate use of the
original basic interrupt model with either non-vectored or vectored transfer to a handler
function, with the 4-byte (or greater) aligned table base address held
in the upper bits of {tvec}.

NOTE: WARL means "Write Any, Read Legal" indicating that any value can
be attempted to be written but only some supported values will actually
be written.

NOTE: CLIC mode is enabled using previously reserved values (`*11`)
in the low two bits of mtvec.

=== CLIC compared to PLIC

The standard RISC-V platform-level interrupt controller (PLIC)
provides centralized interrupt prioritization and routing for shared
platform-level interrupts, and sends only a single external interrupt
signal per privilege mode (`meip`/`seip`/`ueip`) to each hart.

The CLIC complements the PLIC.  Smaller single-core systems might have
only a CLIC, while multicore systems might have a CLIC per-core and a
single shared PLIC.  The PLIC ``**__x__**eip`` signals are treated as
hart-local interrupt sources by the CLIC at each core.

=== CLIC compared to Original Basic Interrupt Controller

The existing original basic interrupt controller was a small unit
that provided local interrupts based on earlier designs, and managed
the software, timer, and external interrupt signals
(``**__x__**sip``/``**__x__**tip``/``**__x__**eip`` signals in
the {ip} register).  This basic controller also allowed additional
custom fast interrupt signals to be added in bits 16 and up of the
{ip} register.

New settings of {tvec} mode as described below are used to enable CLIC
modes instead of the original basic interrupt modes.  Platform profiles may
require either or both of the original basic and CLIC interrupt modes.

=== CLIC compared to Advanced Interrupt Architecture

Advanced interrupt Architecture (AIA) supports message-signaled interrupts (MSIs) and an Advanced PLIC (APLIC) and targeted to support multiple harts, and support for virtualization.  Like CLIC, the relative priority of all interrupts (not just external) can be configured. CLIC is targeted at CLIC per-core and has the option to give each interrupt source a separate trap entry address,  preemption (nesting) of interrupts with adjustable priority threshold control, and support for software tailchaining.

== CLIC Overview

This section gives an overview for the Core-Local Interrupt
Controller (CLIC) that receives interrupt signals and presents the next
interrupt to be processed to the processor.

The CLIC supports up to 4096 interrupt inputs per hart.
Each interrupt input _i_ has four 8-bit memory-mapped control
registers: an interrupt-pending bit (`clicintip[__i__]`),
an interrupt-enable bit (`clicintie[__i__]`), interrupt attributes
(`clicintattr[__i__]`) to specify privilege mode and trigger type,
and interrupt control bits to specify level
and priority (`clicintctl[__i__]`).

The first 16 interrupt inputs are reserved for the original basic mode
interrupts present in the low 16 bits of the {ip} and {ie} registers,
so up to 4080 local external interrupts can be added.

=== Interrupt Preemption

The CLIC extends interrupt preemption to support up to 256 interrupt
levels for each privilege mode, where higher-numbered interrupt levels
can preempt lower-numbered interrupt levels.  Interrupt level 0
corresponds to regular execution outside of an interrupt handler.
Levels 1--255 correspond to interrupt handler levels. Platform
profiles will dictate how many interrupt levels must be supported.

Incoming interrupts with a higher interrupt level can preempt an
active interrupt handler running at a lower interrupt level in the
same privilege mode, provided interrupts are globally enabled in this
privilege mode.

NOTE: Existing RISC-V interrupt behavior is retained, where incoming
interrupts for a higher privilege mode can preempt an active interrupt
handler running in a lower privilege mode, regardless of global
interrupt enable in lower privilege mode.

=== CLIC Interaction with Other Local Interrupts

The CLIC subsumes the functionality of the basic local interrupts
previously provided in bits 16 and up of {ip}/{ie}, so these are no
longer visible in {ip}/{ie}.

The existing timer (`mtip`/`stip`/`utip`), software
(`msip`/`ssip`/`usip`), and external interrupt inputs
(`meip`/`seip`/`ueip`) are treated as additional local interrupt
sources, where the privilege mode, interrupt level, and priority can
be altered using memory-mapped `clicintattr[__i__]` and
`clicintctl[__i__]` registers.

NOTE: In CLIC mode, interrupt delegation for these signals is achieved
via changing the interrupt's privilege mode in the CLIC Interrupt
Attribute Register (`clicintattr`), as with any other CLIC
interrupt input.

== CLIC Memory-Mapped Registers

=== CLIC Memory Map

The base address of CLIC memory-mapped registers is specified
at a new CLIC Base (`mclicbase`) Control and Status Register (CSR).

The CLIC memory map supports up to 4096 total interrupt inputs.

----
A 32-bit write to {clicintctl,clicintattr,clicintie,clicintip} is legal. However, there is no specified order in which the effects of the individual byte updates take effect.

If an input _i_ is not present in the hardware, the corresponding
`clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, `clicintattr[__i__]`,
`clicintctl[__i__]` memory locations appear hardwired to zero.

All CLIC-memory mapped registers are visible to M-mode.
Interrupt registers `clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, `clicintattr[__i__]`, `clicintctrl[__i__]` configured as M-mode interrupts are not acessible to S-mode and U-mode.
Interrupt registers `clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, `clicintattr[__i__]`, `clicintctrl[__i__]` configured as S-mode interrupts are not acessible to U-mode.

In S-mode, any interrupt _i_ that is not accessible to S-mode appears as
hard-wired zeros in `clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, `clicintattr[__i__]`, and
`clicintctl[__i__]`.

Likewise, in U-mode, any interrupt _i_ that is not accessible to U-mode appears as
hard-wired zeros in `clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, `clicintattr[__i__]`, and
`clicintctl[__i__]`.

=== CLIC Configuration (`cliccfg`)

The CLIC has a single memory-mapped 8-bit global configuration
register, `cliccfg`, that defines how many privilege modes are supported,
how the `clicintctl[__i__]` registers are subdivided into level and
priority fields, and whether selective hardware vectoring is supported.

The `cliccfg` register has three WARL fields, a 2-bit `nmbits` field,
a 4-bit `nlbits` field, and a 1-bit `nvbits` field, plus a reserved
bit WPRI-hardwired to zero in current spec.

NOTE: WPRI means "Writes Preserve Values, Reads Ignore Values"
indicating whole read/write fields are reserved for future use. Software
should ignore the values read from these fields, and should preserve
the values held in these fields when writing values to other fields of
the same register. For forward compatibility, implementations that do
not furnish these fields must hardwire them to zero.

Detailed explanation for each field are described in the following sections.

==== Specifying Interrupt Privilege Mode

The 2-bit `cliccfg.nmbits` WARL field specifies how many bits are 
physically implemented in `clicintattr[__i__].mode` to
represent an input __i__'s privilege mode. Although `cliccfg.nmbits` field
is always 2-bit wide, the physically implemented bits in this field 
can be fewer than two (depending how many interrupt privilege-modes are supported).

For example, in M-mode-only systems, only M-mode exists so we do not
need any extra bit to represent the supported privilege-modes. In this case,
no physically implemented bits are needed in the `clicintattr.mode`
and thus `cliccfg.nmbits` is 0 (i.e., `cliccfg.nmbits` can be hardwired to 0).

In M/U-mode systems with N-extension user-level interrupts support, `cliccfg.nmbits` can be
set to 0 or 1.  If `cliccfg.nmbits` = 0, then all interrupts are treated as
M-mode interrupts.  If the `cliccfg.nmbits` = 1, then a value of 1 in
the most-significant bit (MSB) of a `clicintattr[__i__].mode` register
indicates that interrupt intput is taken in M-mode,
while a value of 0 indicates that interrupt is taken in U-mode.

Similarly, in systems that support all M/S/U-mode interrupts, `cliccfg.nmbits`
can be set to 0, 1, or 2 bits to represent privilege-modes.
`cliccfg.nmbits` = 0 indicates that all local interrupts are taken in
M-mode.  `cliccfg.nmbits` = 1 indicates that the MSB selects between M-mode
(1) and S-mode (0).  `cliccfg.nmbits` = 2 indicates that the two MSBs of
each `clicintattr[__i__].mode` register encode the interrupt's privilege
mode using the same encoding as the `mstatus.mpp` field.

NOTE: Bare S-mode (no MMU, satp=0) can be used in microcontrollers to allow hardware delegation of interrupts out of M-mode. Bare S-mode has already been ratified as part of privileged architecture. There are also proposals to add S-mode PMP support to allow an RTOS running in S-mode to isolate itself from tasks running in U-mode. The proposed N-extension would also add user-mode interrupts and traps, but has not been ratified and is not currently being advanced.

==== Specifying Interrupt Level

The 4-bit `cliccfg.nlbits` WARL field indicates how many upper bits
in `clicintctl[__i__]` are assigned to encode the interrupt level.
Valid values are 0--8.

Although the interrupt level is an 8-bit unsigned integer, the number
of bits actually assigned or implemented can be fewer than 8.
As described above, the number of bits assigned is specified in
`cliccfg.nlbits`. The number of bits actually implemented can be derived
from `cliccfg.nlbits` and a fixed parameter `clicinfo.CLICINTCTLBITS`
(with value between 0 to 8) which specifies bits implemented for both
interrupt level and priority.

If the actual bits assigned or implemented are fewer than 8, then these bits
are left-justified and appended with 1's for the lower missing bits.
For example, if the `nlbits` {gt} `CLICINTCTLBITS`, then the lower bits of
the 8-bit interrupt level are assumed to be all 1s.  Similarly,
if `nlbits` {lt} 8, then the lower bits of the 8-bit interrupt level are
assumed to be all 1s. The following table shows how levels are encoded
for these cases.

----

 "l" bits are available variable bits in level specification
 "." bits are non-existent bits for level encoding, assumed to be 1
----

If `nlbits` = 0, then all interrupts are treated as level 255.

Examples of `cliccfg` settings:

 CLICINTCTLBITS nlbits clicintctl[i] interrupt levels
       0         2      ........     255

       4         1      lppp....     127,255

 "." bits are non-existent bits for level encoding, assumed to be 1
 "l" bits are available variable bits in level specification
 "p" bits are available variable bits in priority specification

==== Specifying Interrupt Priority

The least-significant bits in `clicintctl[__i__]` that are not
configured to be part of the interrupt level are interrupt priority,
which are used to prioritize among interrupts pending-and-enabled at
the same privilege mode and interrupt level. The highest-priority
interrupt at a given privilege mode and interrupt level is taken first.
In case there are multiple pending-and-enabled interrupts at the
same highest priority, the highest-numbered interrupt is taken first.

NOTE: The highest numbered interrupt wins in a tie (when
privilege mode, level and priority are all identical). This is the same
as the original basic interrupt mode, but different than the PLIC.

Notice that the 8-bit interrupt level is used to determine preemption
(for nesting interrupts). In contrast, the 8-bit interrupt priority
does not affect preemption but is only used as a tie-breaker
when there are multiple pending interrupts with the same interrupt level.

Any implemented priority bits are treated as the most-significant bits
of a 8-bit unsigned integer with lower unimplemented bits set to 1.
For example, with one priority bit (`p111_1111`), interrupts can be
set to have priorities 127 or 255, and with two priority bits
(`pp11_1111`), interrupts can be set to have priorities 63, 127, 191,
or 255.

==== Specifying Support for Selective Interrupt Hardware Vectoring

The single-bit read-only `nvbits` field in `cliccfg` specifies whether
the selective interrupt hardware vectoring feature is implemented or not.

This selective hardware vectoring feature gives users the flexibility to
select the behavior for each interrupt: either hardware vectoring or
non-vectoring. As a result, it allows users to optimize each interrupt
and enjoy the benefits of both behaviors. More specifically, hardware vectoring
has the advantage of faster interrupt response at the price of slightly
increasing the code size (to save/restore contexts). On the other hand,
non-vectoring has the advantage of smaller code size (by sharing and
reusing one copy of common code to save/restore contexts) at the price of
slightly slower interrupt response.

When `nvbits` is 0, selective interrupt hardware vectoring is not implemented.
In this case, all interrupts are non-vectored and are directed to the common code
at {tvec} register.


When `nvbits` is 1, selective interrupt hardware vectoring is implemented.
The bit `clicintattr[__i__].shv` controls the vectoring behavior of
interrupt _i_.  If `clicintattr[__i__].shv` is 0, then
the interrupt is non-vectored and always jumps to the common code at
{tvec}.
If `clicintattr[__i__].shv` is 1, then the interrupt is hardware vectored
to the trap-handler function pointer specified in {tvt} CSR.
This allows some interrupts to
all jump to a common base address held in {tvec}, while the others are
vectored in hardware via a table pointed to by the additional {tvt}
CSR.


=== CLIC Information (`clicinfo`)

This is a read-only register to show information useful for debugging.

[source]
----
  clicinfo register layout

  Bits    Field
  31      reserved (WARL 0)

  24:21   CLICINTCTLBITS

          20:17 for architecture version, 16:13 for implementation version
  12:0    num_interrupt (number of maximum interrupt inputs supported)
  
----

The `num_interrupt` field specifies the actual number of maximum interrupt
inputs supported in this implementation.

The `version` field specifies the implementation version of CLIC. The upper
4-bit specifies the architecture version, and the lower 4-bit specifies
the implementation version.

The `CLICINTCTLBITS` field specifies how many hardware bits are actually
implemented in the `clicintctl` registers, with 0 {le} `CLICINTCTLBITS` {le} 8.
The implemented bits are kept left-justified in the most-significant bits of
each 8-bit `clicintctl[__i__]` register, with the lower unimplemented bits
treated as hardwired to 1.

The `num_trigger` field specifies the number of maximum interrupt
triggers supported in this implementation. Valid values are 0 to 32.


=== CLIC Interrupt Pending (`clicintip`)

Each interrupt input has a dedicated interrupt pending bit
(`clicintip[__i__]`) and occupies one byte in the memory map for ease
of access.  The pending bit is located in bit 0 of the byte.  Software
should assume `clicintip[__i__]=0` means no interrupt pending, and
`clicintip[__i__]!=0` indicates an interrupt is pending to accomodate
possible future expansion of the `clicintip` field.

When the input is configured for level-sensitive input, the
`clicintip[__i__]` bit reflects the value of an input signal to the
interrupt controller after any conditional inversion specified by the
`clicintattr[i]` field, and software writes to the bit are ignored.
Software clears the interrupt at the source device.

When the input is configured for edge-sensitive input,
`clicintip[__i__]` is a read-write register that can be updated both
by hardware interrupt inputs and by software.  The bit is set by
hardware after an edge of the appropriate polarity is observed on the
interrupt input, as determined by the `clicintattr[i]` field.
Hardware clears the associated interrupt pending bit when an
interrupt is serviced in vectored mode.  Software writes can set or
clear edge-triggered pending bits, either directly by writes to the
memory-mapped register or by accessing the {nxti} CSR.

NOTE: To improve performance, when a vectored interrupt is selected
and serviced, the hardware will automatically clear a corresponding
edge-triggered pending bit, so software doesn't need to clear the
pending bit in the service routine.

In contrast, when a non-vectored (common code) interrupt is selected,
the hardware will not automatically clear an edge-triggered pending
bit.

NOTE: Software is expected to use an access to the {nxti} CSR to clear
an edge-triggered pending bit in non-vectored mode.  Additional detail
on this is described in the {nxti} section.

The value in the `clicintip[__i__]` is undefined when switching from
level-sensitive mode to edge-triggered mode in `clicintattr[__i__]`.

NOTE: Software cannot rely on the underlying `clicintip[__i__]`
register bits used in edge-triggered mode to hold state while in
level-sensitive mode.

=== CLIC Interrupt Enable (`clicintie`)
Each interrupt input has a dedicated interrupt-enable bit (`clicintie[__i__]`)
and occupies one byte in the memory map for ease of access. This control bit is
read-write to enable/disable the corresponding interrupt.

NOTE: `clicintie[__i__]` is the individual enable bit while {status}.{ie} is
the global enable bit for the current privilege mode. Therefore, for an
interrupt `_i_` to be enabled in the current privilege mode, both `clicintie[__i__]`
and {status}.{ie} have to be set.


NOTE: In contrast, since {status}.{ie} only takes effect in the current privilege 
mode according to RISC-V convention, an interrupt `_i_` from a higher privilege mode
is enabled as long as `clicintie[__i__]` is set (regardless of the setting
of {status}.{ie} in the higher privilege modes).


=== CLIC Interrupt Attribute (`clicintattr`)

This is an 8-bit WARL read-write register to specify various attributes for each interrupt.

[source]
----
  clicintattr register layout

  Bits    Field 
  7:6     mode
  5:3     reserved (WPRI 0)
  2:1     trig
  0       shv
----

The 1-bit `shv` field is used for Selective Hardware Vectoring. 
If `shv` is 0, it assigns this interrupt to be non-vectored and thus it jumps
to the common code at {tvec}. 
If `shv` is 1, it assigns this interrupt to be hardware vectored and thus it
automatically jumps to the trap-handler function pointer specified in {tvt} CSR.
This feature allows some interrupts to all jump to a common base address held
in {tvec}, while the others are vectored in hardware via a table pointed to
by the additional {tvt} CSR.

NOTE: if `cliccfg.nvbits` is 0, the selective interrupt hardware vectoring
feature is not implemented and thus `shv` field appears hardwired to
zero (WARL 0).


The 2-bit `trig` WARL field specifies the trigger type and polarity for each
interrupt input. Bit 1, `trig[0]`, is defined as "edge-triggered"
(0: level-triggered, 1: edge-triggered); while bit 2, `trig[1]`, is defined
as "negative-edge" (0: positive-edge, 1: negative-edge).
More specifically, there can be four possible combinations:
positive level-triggered, negative level-triggered, positive edge-triggered,
and negative edge-triggered.

NOTE: Some implementations may want to save these bits so only certain trigger
types are supported. In this case, these bits become hard-wired to fixed
values (WARL).

The 2-bit `mode` WARL field specifies which privilege mode this interrupt
operates in. This field uses the same encoding as the `mstatus.mpp`
(11: machine mode, 01: supervisor mode, 00 user mode). The default value
for `clicintattr.mode` is 11 to represent machine mode. The valid length of
this field can be programmed with `cliccfg.nmbits`.

NOTE: For security purpose, the `mode` field can only be set to a privilege level that is equal to or lower than the currently running privilege level.


=== CLIC Interrupt Input Control (`clicintctl`)

`clicintctl[__i__]` is an 8-bit memory-mapped WARL control register
to specify interrupt level and interrupt priority.
The number of bits actually implemented in this register is specified
by a fixed parameter `CLICINTCTLBITS` (in `clicinfo`), which has a value
between 0 to 8. The implemented bits are kept left-justified
in the most-significant bits of each 8-bit `clicintctl[__i__]`
register, with the lower unimplemented bits treated as hardwired to 1.
These control bits are interpreted as level and priority according to
the setting in the CLIC Configuration register (`cliccfg.nlbits`).

To select an interrupt to present to the core, the CLIC hardware
combines the valid bits in `clicintattr.mode` and
`clicintctl` to form an unsigned integer, then picks the global maximum
across all pending-and-enabled interrupts based on this value.
Next, the `cliccfg` setting determines how to split
the `clicintctl` value into interrupt level and interrupt
priority. Finally, the interrupt level of this selected interrupt is
compared with the interrupt-level threshold of the associated privilege
mode to determine whether it is qualified or masked by the threshold
(and thus no interrupt is presented).


NOTE: Selecting an interrupt at a high privilege mode masks any
interrupt at a lower privilege mode since the higher-privilege mode
causes the interrupt signal to appear more urgent than any lower-privilege
mode interrupt.


==== Interrupt Input Identification Number

The 4096 CLIC interrupt vectors are given unique identification numbers
with {cause} Exception Code (`exccode`) values.  To maintain backward
compatibility, the original basic mode interrupts retain their original
cause values, while the new interrupts are numbered starting at 16.

NOTE: When upgrading an earlier original basic interrupt controller
that had local interrupts attached directly to bits 16 and above, these
local interrupts can be now attached as CLIC inputs 16 and above to
retain the same interrupt IDs.


=== CLIC Interrupt Trigger (`clicinttrig`)

Optional interrupt triggers (`clicinttrig[__i__]`) are used to generate
a breakpoint exception, entry into Debug Mode, or a trace action.
The actual number of triggers supported is specified in
`clicinfo.num_trigger`.

Each interrupt trigger is a 32-bit memory-mapped WARL register with the
following layout:

[source]
----
  clicinttrig register layout

  Bits    Field
  31      enable
  30:13   reserved (WARL 0)
  12:0    interrupt_number
  
----

The `interrupt_number` field selects which number of interrupt input
is used as the source for this interrupt trigger.

The `enable` control bit is read-write to enable/disable this
interrupt trigger.

The detailed behavior of the trigger is defined in the debug spec.
For example, the trigger only fires if the interrupt is
actually taken (and not when the interrupt is masked, or not taken).
In addition, the requested action (e.g., breakpoint or trace) is taken
just before the first instruction of the interrupt handler is executed.

== CLIC CSRs

This section describes the CLIC-related hart-specific Control and Status Registers (CSRs). When in
original basic interrupt mode, the behavior is intended to be software
compatible with basic-mode-only systems.

The interrupt-handling CSRs are listed below, with changes and
additions for CLIC mode described in the following sections.

[source]

         m is the nibble encoding the privilege mode (M=0x3, S=0x1, U=0x0)
----

=== Changes to {status} CSRs

When in original basic interrupt mode, the {status} register behavior is unchanged
(i.e., backwards-compatible with original basic mode).  When in CLIC mode,
the {pp} and {pie} in {status} are now accessible
via fields in the {cause} register.

=== Changes to Delegation ({edeleg}/{ideleg}) CSRs

In CLIC mode,
the `mode` field in Interrupt Attribute Register (`clicintattr[__i__].mode`)
specifies the privilege mode in which each interrupt should be taken,
so the {ideleg} CSR ceases to have effect in CLIC mode.  The {ideleg}
CSR is still accessible and state bits retain their values when
switching between CLIC and original basic interrupt modes.

Exception delegation specified by {edeleg} functions the same in CLIC
mode as in original basic mode.

=== Changes to {ie}/{ip} CSRs

The {ie} CSR appears hardwired to zero in CLIC mode, replaced by separate
memory-mapped interrupt enables (`clicintie[__i__]`).

The {ip} CSR appears hardwired to zero in CLIC mode, replaced by
separate memory-mapped interrupt pendings (`clicintip[__i__]`).

Writes to {ie}/{ip} will be ignored and will not trap (i.e., no access faults).
{ie}/{ip} always appear to be zero in CLIC mode.

In systems that support both original basic and CLIC modes, the state bits in
{ie} and {ip} retain their value when switching between modes.

=== New {tvec} CSR Mode for CLIC

The new CLIC interrupt-handling mode is encoded as a new state in the
existing {tvec} WARL register, where {tvec}.`mode` (the least-significant two bits) is
`11`.  In this mode, the trap vector base address held in
{tvec} is constrained to be aligned on a 64-byte or larger
power-of-two boundary.

NOTE: Although future CLIC versions may allow privileges to have different 
{tvec}.`mode` settings, for now all privilege modes must run in either CLIC mode 
or all privilege modes must run in non-CLIC mode.

 NBASE = mtvec[XLEN-1:6]<<6   # New vector base is at least 64-byte aligned.
 TBASE = mtvt[XLEN-1:6]<<6    # Trap vector table base is at least 64-byte aligned.

----

In CLIC mode, writing `0` to `clicintattr[__i__].shv`
sets interrupt `i` to non-vectored,
where the processor jumps to the
trap handler address held in the upper XLEN-6 bits of
{tvec} for all exceptions and interrupts in privilege mode
`**__x__**`. Similarly, if the selective hardware
vectoring feature is not implemented (`cliccfg.nvbits` is `0`),
all interrupts are non-vectored and behave the same.

On the other hand, writing `1` to `clicintattr[__i__].shv`
sets interrupt `i` to vectored. In this case, the processor
switches to the handler's privilege mode and sets the hardware
vectoring bit {inhv} in {cause}, then fetches an XLEN-bit handler
address from the in-memory table whose base address (TBASE) is in
{tvt}.  The trap handler function address is fetched from
`TBASE+XLEN/8*exccode`.  If the fetch is successful, the processor
clears the low bit of the handler address, sets the PC to this handler
address, then clears the {inhv} bit in {cause}.  The overall effect
is:

     pc := M[TBASE + XLEN/8 * exccode] & ~1

[source]
----
           # Vector table layout for RV32 (4-byte function pointers)
  mtvt ->  0x800000 # Interrupt 0 handler function pointer
           0x800004 # Interrupt 1 handler function pointer
           0x800008 # Interrupt 2 handler function pointer
           0x80000c # Interrupt 3 handler function pointer

           0x800010 # Interrupt 2 handler function pointer
           0x800018 # Interrupt 3 handler function pointer
----

NOTE: The original basic vectored mode simply jumped to an address in
the trap vector table, while the new CLIC vectored mode reads a
handler function address from the table, and jumps to it in hardware.

NOTE: The vector table contains vector addresses rather than
instructions because it simplifies  static initialization in C.
More specifically, the entries in the table are simple XLEN-bit
function pointers.

NOTE: The hardware vectoring bit {inhv} is provided to allow resumable
traps on fetches to the trap vector table.

The inhv bits are only written by hardware during the table vector
read operation. The inhv bits can be written by software, including
when hardware vectoring is not in effect. The inhv bit has no effect
except when returning from a trap using an {ret} instruction.  When
returning from an {ret} instruction, the {inhv} bit modifies behavior
as follow:

----
if (xinhv)
    pc := M[xepc]
else
    pc := xepc
----

Implementations might support only one of original basic or CLIC mode.
If only basic mode is supported, writes to bit 1 are ignored and it is
always set to zero (current behavior).  If only CLIC mode is supported,
writes to bit 1 are also ignored and it is always set to one.  CLIC
mode hardwires {tvec} bits 2-5 to zero (assuming no further CLIC
extensions are supported).

For permissions-checking purposes, the memory access to retrieve the
function pointer for vectoring is treated as a load with the privilege
mode (also obeying MPRV and SUM bits) and interrupt level of the interrupt handler.
If there is an access exception on the table load, both {tval} and {epc} holds the faulting address.

NOTE: Horizontal traps (same privilege level) are unrecoverable. The interesting case is vertical traps, where a more privileged layer is handling page faults or other synchronous faults on vector table access. The regular code path in more privileged layer will want to use xtval to determine what bad virtual address to page in, but will not normally restore xtval when returning to faulting context (potentially after some time and other contexts have run) However, it will restore xepc (using x for more privileged mode here) before using xret on normal code path.  This is a rationale for why both {tval} and {epc} are written with the faulting address.

In CLIC mode, synchronous exception traps always jump to NBASE.

=== New {tvt} CSRs

The {tvt} WARL XLEN-bit CSR holds the base address of the trap vector
table, aligned on a 64-byte or greater power-of-two boundary. The actual
alignment can be determined by writing ones to the low-order bits then reading
them back. Values other than 0 in the low 6 bits of {tvt} are reserved.

In systems that support both original basic and CLIC modes, the {tvt} CSR is
still accessible in basic mode (but does not have any effect).

=== Changes to {epc} CSRs

The {epc} CSRs behave the same in both modes, capturing the PC at
which execution was interrupted.

=== Changes to {cause} CSRs

In both original basic and CLIC modes, the {cause} CSR is written at the
time an interrupt or synchronous trap is taken, recording the reason for
the interrupt or trap.  For CLIC mode, {cause} is also extended to record
more information about the interrupted context, which is used to
reduce the overhead to save and restore that context for an {ret}
instruction. CLIC mode {cause} also adds state to record progress
through the trap handling process.

 mcause
 Bits    Field      Description
 XLEN-1 Interrupt    Interrupt=1, Exception=0
    30  minhv        Set by hardware at start of hardware vectoring, cleared by hardware at end of successful hardware vectoring

    27  mpie         Previous interrupt enable, same as mstatus.mpie
 26:24  (reserved)   
 23:16  mpil[7:0]    Previous interrupt level
 15:12  (reserved)
 11:0  Exccode[11:0] Exception/interrupt code

The `mcause.mpp` and `mcause.mpie` fields mirror the `mstatus.mpp` and
`mstatus.mpie` fields, and are aliased into `mcause` to reduce context
save/restore code.

If the hart is currently running at some privilege mode (`pp`) at some
interrupt level (`pil`) and an enabled interrupt becomes pending at
any interrupt level in a higher privilege mode or if an interrupt at a
higher interrupt level in the current privilege mode becomes pending
and interrupts are globally enabled in this privilege mode, then
execution is immediately transferred to a handler running with the new
interrupt's privilege mode (`**__x__**`) and interrupt level (`il`).

The CSR {epc} is set to the PC of the interrupted application
code or preempted interrupt handler, while the {cause}
register now captures the previous privilege mode (`pp`), interrupt
level (`pil`) and interrupt enable (`pie`), as well as the id of the
interrupt in `exccode`.

In systems supporting both original basic and CLIC modes, the new
CLIC-specific fields (`minhv`, `mpp`, `mpil`, `mpie`) appear to be
hardwired to zero in basic mode for backwards compatibilty.  When
basic mode is written to {tvec}, the new {cause} state fields
(`mhinv` and `mpil`) are zeroed.  The other new {cause} fields,
`mpp` and `mpie`, appear as zero in the {cause} CSR but the corresponding
state bits in the `mstatus` register are not cleared.

The supervisor `scause` register has only a single `spp` bit (to
indicate user/supervisor) mirrored from `sstatus.spp`, while the user
`ucause` register has no `upp` bit as interrupts can only have come
from user mode.

For exceptions, in CLIC mode, the `mcause` has the new CLIC format.
On the other hand, in other modes, the `mcause` has the original format.


=== Next Interrupt Handler Address and Interrupt-Enable CSRs ({nxti})

The {nxti} CSR can be used by software to service the next horizontal
interrupt for the same privilege mode when it has greater level than
the saved interrupt context (held in {cause}`.pil`) and greater level
than the interrupt threshold of the corresponding privilege mode, without incuring
the full cost of an interrupt pipeline flush and context save/restore.
The {nxti} CSR is designed to be accessed using CSRRSI/CSRRCI
instructions, where the value read is a pointer to an entry in the
trap handler table and the write back updates the interrupt-enable
status. In addition, accesses to the {nxti} have side-effects that
update the interrupt context state.

NOTE: This is different than a regular CSR instruction as the value
returned is different from the value used in the read-modify-write
operation.

A read of the {nxti} CSR returns either zero, indicating there is no
suitable interrupt to service or that the highest ranked interrupt is
SHV or that the system is not in a CLIC mode, or returns a non-zero
address of the entry in the trap handler table for software trap
vectoring.

NOTE: The {tvt} CSR could be set to memory addresses such that a table
entry was at address zero, and this would be indistinguishable from
the no-interrupt case.

If the CSR instruction that acccesses {nxti} includes a write, the
{status} CSR is the one used for the read-modify-write portion of the
operation, while the {cause} register's `exccode` field and the
{intstatus} register's {il} field can also be updated with
the new interrupt id and level respectively.

NOTE: Following the usual convention for CSR instructions, if the CSR
instruction does not include write side effects (e.g., `csrr t0,
{nxti}`), then no state update on any CSR occurs.  This can be used to
determine if an interrupt could be taken without actually updating
{il} and `exccode`.

The {nxti} CSR is intended to be used inside an interrupt handler
after an initial interrupt has been taken and {cause} and {epc}
registers updated with the interrupted context and the id of the
interrupt.

If the pending interrupt is edge-triggered, hardware will automatically 
clear the corresponding pending bit only when software uses a
`csrrsi/csrrci {nxti}` instruction to select this interrupt and return its
entry address. However, if the CSR instruction does not include write side effects
(e.g., `csrr t0, {nxti}`), then no state update on any CSR occurs and thus the
interrupt pending bit is not cleared. This behavior allows software to optimize the
selection and execution of interrupts using `{nxti}`.

[source]
--
 // Pseudo-code for csrrsi rd, mnxti, uimm[4:0] in M mode.
 mstatus |= uimm[4:0]; // Performed regardless of interrupt readiness.
 if (clic.priv==M && clic.level > mcause.pil && clic.level > mintthresh.th
     && (cliccfg.nvbits==0 || clicintattr.shv==0) ) {
   // The CLIC interrupt should be serviced before returning to the saved context,
   // unless it's a selectively hardware vectored interupt.
   mintstatus.mil = clic.level; // Update hart's interrupt level.
   mcause.exccode = clic.id;   // Update interrupt id.
   rd = TBASE + XLEN/8 * clic.id; // Return pointer to trap handler entry.
 } else {
   // No interrupt, or a selectively hardware vectored interrupt, or in non-CLIC mode.
   rd = 0;
 }
--

NOTE: Vertical interrupts to different privilege modes will be taken
preemptively by the hardware, so {nxti} effectively only ever handles
the next interrupt in the same privilege mode.

In original basic mode, reads of {nxti} return 0, updates to {status} proceed
as in CLIC mode, but updates to {intstatus} and {cause} do not take
effect.

=== New Interrupt Status ({intstatus}) CSRs

A new M-mode CSR, `mintstatus`, holds the active interrupt level for
each supported privilege mode.  These fields are read-only.  The
primary reason to expose these fields is to support debug.

 mintstatus fields
 31:24 mil
 23:16 (reserved) # To follow pattern of others.
 15: 8 sil
  7: 0 uil

Corresponding supervisor mode, `sintstatus`, and user, `uintstatus`,
provide restricted views of mintstatus.

 sintstatus fields
 31:16 (reserved)
 15: 8 sil
  7: 0 uil

 uintstatus fields
 31: 8 (reserved)
  7: 0 uil

The {intstatus} registers are accessible in original basic mode for system that
support both modes.

=== New Interrupt-Level Threshold ({intthresh}) CSRs

The interrupt-level threshold ({intthresh}) is a new read-write CSR,
which holds an 8-bit field (`th`) for the threshold level of the
associated privilege mode. 

A typical usage of the interrupt-level threshold is for implementing
critical sections. The current handler can temporarily raise its effective
interrupt level to implement a critical section among a subset of levels,
while still allowing higher interrupt levels to preempt.

The current hart's effective interrupt level would then be:
    effective_level = max({intstatus}.{il}, {intthresh}.`th`)

The max is used to prevent a hart from dropping below its original level
which would break assumptions in design, and also makes it
simple for software to remove threshold without knowing its own level
by simply writing zero.

The interrupt-level threshold is only valid when running in associated
privilege mode and not in other modes. This is because interrupts for
lower privilege modes are always disabled, whereas interrupts for higher
privilege modes are always enabled. For example, machine-mode interrupts
will not be masked by machine-mode threshold setting when running in user mode.
This is analogous to how mstatus.mie does not mask machine-mode interrupts
when running in lower privilege modes.

NOTE: This behavior significantly reduces the hardware cost because it only
needs to select one global maximum interrupt and compare with the threshold
of the associated privilege mode (while ignoring thresholds in other modes).
Otherwise, hardware would have to select multiple maximum interrupts (one
per privilege mode), compare and qualify with their associated thresholds,
then pick a qualified maximum interrupt with the highest privilege mode.


=== New CLIC Base (`mclicbase`) CSR

The machine mode `mclicbase` CSR is an XLEN-bit read-only register
providing the base address of CLIC memory mapped registers.
Its value should be configured or set up at the platform level to indicate
the starting address of CLIC memory mapped registers. 

Since the CLIC memory map must be aligned at a 4KiB boundary, the `mclicbase`
CSR has its 12 least-significant bits hardwired to zero. It is used
to inform software about the location of CLIC memory mappped registers.

----

== CLIC Reset Behavior
In general in RISC-V, mandatory reset state is minimized but 
platforms or company policy might add additional reset requirements.  Since the 
general privileged architecture states that mstatus.mie is reset to zero, 
interrupts will not be enabled coming out of reset.  For an S-mode only 
execution environment, the EEI should specify that status.sie is also reset 
on entry. It is then responsibility of EEI implementation to ensure that 
is true before beginning execution in S-mode. Similarly for other lower-mode 
execution environments.

=== CLIC mandatory reset state
`cliccfg.nmbits` and `cliccfg.nlbits` fields reset to 0 (i.e., all interrupts are M-mode at
level 255).

{intstatus}.{il} fields reset to 0.  Interrupt level 0 corresponds to regular
execution outside of an interrupt handler.

== CLIC Interrupt Operation

This section describes the operation of CLIC interrupts.

=== General Interrupt Overview

At any time, a hart is running in some privilege mode with some
interrupt level.  The hart's privilege mode is held internally in the
processor but is not visible to software running on a hart (to avoid
virtualization holes), but the current interrupt level is made visible
in the {intstatus} register.  

Within a privilege mode `*_x_*`, if the associated global
interrupt-enable {ie} is clear, then no interrupts will be taken in
that privilege mode, but a pending-enabled interrupt in a higher
privilege mode will preempt current execution.  If {ie} is set, then
pending-enabled interrupts at a higher interrupt level in the same
privilege mode will preempt current execution and run the interrupt
handler for the higher interrupt level.

As with the existing RISC-V mechanism, when an interrupt or
synchronous exception is taken, the privilege mode and interrupt level
are modified to reflect the new privilege mode and interrupt level.
The global interrupt-enable bit of the handler's privilege mode is
cleared, to prevent preemption by higher-level interrupts in the same
privilege mode.

The overall behavior is summarized in the following table: the Current
`p/ie/il` fields represent the current privilege mode `P` (not
software visible), interrupt enable `ie` = 
({status}.{ie} & `clicintie[__i__]`)  and interrupt
level `L` = max({intstatus}.{il}, {intthresh}.`th`);
the CLIC `priv`,`level`, and `id` fields
represent the highest-ranked interrupt currently present in the CLIC
with `nP` representing the new privilege mode, `nL` representing the
new interrupt level, and `id` representing the interrupt's id;
Current' shows the `p/ie/il` context in the handler's privilege mode;
`pc` represents the program counter with `V` representing the result
of any hardware vectoring; `cde` represents the {cause} `exccode`
field; while the Previous `pp/il/ie/epc` columns represent previous
context fields in {cause} and {epc}.

 Current  |      CLIC          |->      Current'          Previous

----

=== Critical Sections in Interrupt Handlers

To implement a critical section between interrupt handlers at
different levels in the same privilege mode, an interrupt handler at
any interrupt level can temporarily raise the interrupt-level threshold
(`mintthresh.th`) to mask a subset of levels,
while still allowing higher interrupt levels to preempt.
Alternatively, although not recommended due to worse system impacts, it can 
clear the mode's global interrupt-enable bit 
({ie}) to prevent any interrupts with the same privilege mode from
being taken.

=== Responses to Wait for Interrupt (WFI)

In CLIC, similar to original mode, Wait for Interrupt instruction (WFI) is
unaffected by the global interrupt-enable bits in {status}.{ie} but should
honor `clicintie[__i__]` and {intthresh}. In other words, WFI ignores the 
actual value in the global interrupt-enable {status}.{ie} (by treating as 
if {status}.{ie} were always enabled).

WFI will always wake up if an interrupt has a higher privilege mode and 
is locally enabled with `clicintie[__i__]`.

If the current interrupt-level threshold ({intthresh}.`th`) is greater 
than `0` (activated), enabled interrupts at current privilege mode with 
interrupt level greater than the current threshold will wake up WFI, but 
interrupts from lower privilege modes are usually masked/ignored (same 
as the normal usage of qualifying preemption). On the other hand, 
if the current interrupt-level threshold is `0` (not activated), this `0` 
threshold will not mask any interrupt so any enabled interrupts will wake 
up WFI including those from lower privilege modes.


NOTE: WFI can be a NOP and not actually go to sleep. In addition, 
implementations can wake up WFI for any other reason.

NOTE: WFI should not be placed inside an interrupt handler.

=== Synchronous Exception Handling

Horizontal synchronous exception traps, which stay within a privilege
mode, are serviced with the same interrupt level as the instruction
that raised the exception.

Vertical synchronous exception traps, which are serviced at a higher
privilege mode, are taken at interrupt level 0 in the higher privilege
mode.

WARNING: Traps should be avoided at any time when {epc}/{cause} are live
because these CSRs will be overwritten. Software should try to back them
up if needed.

=== Returns from Handlers

The regular {ret} instructions are used to return from handlers in
privilege mode `*_x_*`.  Execution continues at the saved privilege
mode {cause}.{pp}, at PC {epc}, with interrupt level
{cause}.{pil}, and with the global interrupt enable
for the restored mode as {cause}.{pie}.

The {ret} instruction does not modify the
{cause}.{pil} field in {cause}.  The
{cause}.{pp} and {cause}.{pie} fields
are modified following the behavior previously defined for
{status}.{pp} and {status}.{pie}
respectively.

== Interrupt Handling Software

=== Interrupt Stack Software Conventions

The CLIC supports multiple nested interrupt handlers, and each handler
requires some working registers. To make registers available, each
handler typically saves and restores registers from the interrupted
context on a memory-resident stack.  In addition, the memory-resident
stack is used to hold other interrupted context information, such as
{epc} and {cause}, which are required by the {ret} instruction.

The standard RISC-V ABI convention is that stacks grow downwards, and
that memory addresses below the current stack pointer can be
dynamically altered by another agent, such as an interrupt handler.

When interrupts are taken horizontally within the same privilege mode,
the interrupt handler may be able to use the same stack as the
interrupted thread, by allocating a new stack frame below the current
stack pointer.

When interrupts are taken vertically into a higher privilege mode, the
stack pointer must be swapped to a stack within the higher privilege
mode to avoid a security hole.  The {scratch} registers can be used to
hold the stack pointer of a higher-privilege mode while
lower-privilege code is executing, or {scratch} can be used to point
to more extensive thread-local context that might contain a stack
pointer.

[[inline-section,Inlines]]
=== Inline Interrupt Handlers and "Interrupt Attribute" for C

Inline interrupt handlers are small leaf functions that handle simple
interrupts.  To provide easy C coding for inline interrupt handlers,
while reducing register save/restore overhead, we use standard
interrupt attributes, which have the following syntax:

[source]
----
  /* Small ISR to poke device to clear interrupt and increment in-memory counter. */
  void __attribute__ ((interrupt))
  foo (void)
  {
    extern volatile int INTERRUPT_FLAG;
    INTERRUPT_FLAG = 0;
    extern volatile int COUNTER;
  #ifdef __riscv_atomic
    __atomic_fetch_add (&COUNTER, 1, __ATOMIC_RELAXED);
  #else
    COUNTER++;
  #endif
  }
----

The attribute tells the C compiler to use callee-save for all
registers, so the handler has to "pay as it goes" to use registers,
and only save the full caller-save set if it makes a nested regular C
call.  The attribute also tells the C compiler to align the function
entry point on an 8-byte boundary.

[source]
----
   .align 3
      # Inline non-preemptible interrupt handler.
      # Only safe for horizontal interrupts.
   foo:
      addi sp, sp, -FRAMESIZE      # Create a frame on stack.
      sw a0, OFFSET(sp)            # Save working register.
      sw x0, INTERRUPT_FLAG, a0    # Clear interrupt flag.
      sw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Save working register.
      la a0, COUNTER               # Get counter address.
      li a1, 1
      amoadd.w x0, (a0), a1        # Increment counter in memory.
      lw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Restore registers.
      lw a0, OFFSET(sp)
      addi sp, sp, FRAMESIZE       # Free stack frame.
      mret                         # Return from handler using saved mepc.
----

With hardware vectoring, inline interrupt handlers can provide very
rapid response for small tasks.

NOTE: The above entire handler executes in 13 instructions.  The
`INTERRUPT_FLAG` store and the `la` require two instructions each to
build up a global address.  A simple pipeline would encounter two
pipeline flushes (on entry and on exit), plus the cycles taken to fetch
the hardware vector entry.

These inline handlers can be used with the original basic mode as
well as the new CLIC.

To take advantage of hardware preemption in the new CLIC,
inline handlers must save and restore {epc} and {cause} before
enabling interrupts:

[source]

   .align 3
      # Inline preemptible interuppt handler.
      # Only safe for horizontal interrupts.
   foo:
      #----- Interrupts disabled on entry ---#

      sw x0, INTERRUPT_FLAG, a0    # Clear interrupt flag.
      sw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Save epc on stack.
      la a0, COUNTER               # Get counter address.
      li a1, 1
      amoadd.w x0, (a0), a1        # Increment counter in memory.
      lw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Restore epc
      lw a0, OFFSET(sp)            # Restore cause
      csrrci x0, mstatus, MIE      # Disable interrupts.
      #----- Interrupts disabled  ---------#
      csrw mepc, a1                # Put epc back.
      lw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Restore a1.
      csrw mcause, a0              # Put cause back.
      lw s0, OFFSET(sp)            # Restore s0.
      addi sp, sp, FRAMESIZE       # Free stack frame.
      mret                         # Return from handler.
      #------------------------------------#
----

NOTE: This version requires 10 more instructions, but reduces the time
a preempting interrupt has to wait from a 13-instruction window to a
6-instruction window (the instruction that disables interrupts can be
preempted before committing).

WARNING: This form cannot be used with the existing original basic scheme,
unless the original interrupt pending signal is cleared before
re-enabling interrupts.

== Calling C-ABI Functions as Interrupt Handlers

An alternative model is where all interrupt handler routines use the
standard C ABI.  In this case, the CLIC would use no hardware
vectoring for the C ABI handlers and instead use a common software
trampoline, which uses the {nxti} instruction to obtain the
trap-handler address.  The code sequence below is annotated with an
explanation of its operation.

=== C-ABI Trampoline Code

----

<1> An initial interrupt (II) causes entry to the handler with
interrupts disabled, and {epc} and {cause} CSRs hold values
representing the original interrupted context (OIC), including the PC
in {epc}, the privilege mode in {pp} (visible in both {cause} and
{status}), the interrupt level in {pil} (in {cause}) and the interrupt
enable state in {pie} (visible in both {cause} and {status}).  The
{cause} CSR and the {intstatus} CSRs additionally hold information on
the interrupt to be handled, including `exccode` in {cause} and {il}
in {intstatus}.

<2> The interrupt trampoline needs sufficient space to store the OIC's
caller-save registers as well as its `epc` and `cause` values, which
are saved in a frame on the memory stack to support preemption.  This
routine is M-mode only so does not need to consider swapping stacks
from other privilege modes.  A simple constant bump of the stack
pointer `sp` is sufficient to provide space to store the OIC.

<3> The trap handler could have been entered by a synchronous
exception instead of an interrupt, which can be determined by
examining the sign bit of the returned {cause} value.  If the trap was
for an exception (sign bit zero), the code jumps to exception handler
code while keeping interrupts disabled.

<4> The exception handler code is located here out of line to reduce
performance impact on interrupts.  The main body of the trampoline
only handles interrupts.

<5> If this was an interrupt, the trampoline entry code continues to
save all the caller-save registers to the stack.  This is done with
interrupts disabled, as even if an interrupt arrived with a higher
interrupt level it would still require all registers to be saved.

<6> When {nxti} is read here, the interrupt inputs to the CLIC might
have changed from the time the handler was initially entered.  The
return value of {nxti}, which holds a pointer to an entry in the trap
vector table, is saved in register `a0` so it can be passed as the
first argument to the software-vectored interrupt handler, where it
can be used to reconstruct the original interrupt id in the case where
multiple vector entries use a common handler.  There are multiple
cases to consider, all of which are handled correctly by the
definition of {nxti}:

* The II is still the ranking interrupt (no change).  In this case, as
the level of the II will still be higher than `pil` from the OIC, {il}
and `exccode` will be rewritten with the same value that they already
had (effectively unchanged), and {nxti} will return the table entry
for the II.

* The II has been superceded by a higher-level non-SHV interrupt.  In
this case, {il} will be set to the new higher interrupt level,
`exccode` will be updated to the new interrupt id, and {nxti} will
return the vector table entry for the new higher-level interrupt.  The
OIC is not disturbed, retaining the original `epc` and the original
`pil`.  This case reduces latency to service a more-important
interrupt that arrives after the state-save sequence was begun for the
less-important II.  The II, if still pending-enabled, will be serviced
sometime after the higher-level interrupt as described below.

* The II has been superceded by a higher-priority non-SHV interrupt at
the same level.  This operates similarly to the previous case, with
`exccode` updated to the new interrupt id.  Because the lower-priority
interrupt had not begun to run its service routine, this optimization
preserves the property that interrupt handlers at the same interrupt
level but different priorities execute atomically with respect to each
other (i.e., they do not preempt each other).

* The II has disappeared and a lower-ranked non-SHV interrupt, which
has interrupt level greater than the OIC's `pil` is present in CLIC.
In this case, the {il} of the handler will be reduced to the
lower-ranked interrupt's level, `exccode` will be updated with the new
interrupt id, and {nxti} will return a pointer to the appropriate
handler in table.  In this case, the new lower-ranked interrupt would
still have caused the original context to have been interrupted to run
the handler, and the disappearing II has simply caused the
lower-ranked interrupt's entry and state-save sequence to begin
earlier.

* The II has disappeared and either there is no current interrupt from
the CLIC, or the current ranking interrupt is a non-SHV interrupt with
level lower than {pil}.  In this case, the {il} and `exccode` are not
updated, and 0 is returned by {nxti}.  The following trampoline code
will then not fetch a vector from the table, and instead just restore
the OIC context and `mret` back to it.  This preserves the property
that the OIC completes execution before servicing any new interrupt
with a lower or equal interrupt level.

* The II has been superceded by a higher-level SHV interrupt.  In this
case, the {il} and `exccode` are not updated, and 0 is returned by
{nxti}.  Once interrupts are reenabled for the following instruction,
the processor will preempt the current handler and execute the vectored
interrupt at a higher interrupt level using the function pointer
stored in the vector table.

<7> Interrupts are now enabled.  If a higher-level SHV interrupt had
arrived while interrupts were disabled, then the current handler will
be preempted and execution starts at the SHV handler address.  If a
non-vectored higher-level interrupt arrives now, it will also preempt
the current handler and begin a nested state-save sequence at the
handler entry point `irq_enter`.

<8> The branch checks if the II disappeared or if a higher priority
SHV at the same level appeared, in which case the current handler
returns to the OIC.  As most registers have not been touched, the
routine can skip past most of the register restore code.  This
preserves the property that interrupts (SHV or non-SHV) at the same
level do not preempt each other.

<9> The value returned by {nxti} is used to index the vector table and
return the function pointer.

<10> This `csrrsi` instruction enables interrupts and is redundant
when proceeding sequentially from the first {nxti} read (6) or if
looping back from the end of the `service_loop` (13).  However, it is
required on the backward path from (16) to re-enable interrupts to
allow preemption.  It is scheduled after the table lookup to use what
will often be a load-use delay slot.

<11> The `jalr` instruction actually calls the C ABI function that
implements the handler.  Interrupts are enabled at this point, so the
C function can be preempted at any time by an interrupt with a higher
level than current {il}.

<12> Once the handler returns, another read of {nxti} checks if there
are any more interrupts to service.  Interrupts remain enabled.  The
`csrrsi` includes a redundant set of the {ie} interrupt enable to
force the CSR instruction to update CSR state.  Only non-SHV
interrupts with a level greater than `pil` will be serviced in this
loop.  Note that {il} can decrease from its current value on the
{nxti} read.  {il} should not increase in this code, as interrupts are
enabled here and if a higher-level interrupt was ready, it should have
preempted this instruction.

<13> If there was another appropriate interrupt to service, the code
loops back to perform the next handler call.  The `service_loop` only
contains 5 instructions, allowing multiple back-back interrupts to be
handled without saving and restoring contexts.  On a simple pipeline
with a one-cycle load-use penalty, single-cycle CSR access, and a
one-cycle taken-branch penalty, the service loop can initiate a new
interrupt service with only 7 clock cycles of overhead per handler
call.

<14> This instruction sequence restores the OIC.  Interrupts are still
enabled, so preemption is allowed during this restore.

<15> Interrupts are disabled for the final steps of restoring the OIC,
which requires loading `mcause` and `mepc` from the stacked values,
and recovering the final register values from the OIC.

<16> A final read of {nxti} is performed before returning, to reduce
the maximum interrupt latency.  If a suitable interrupt arrives, it
can be serviced without saving context.  The `csrrci` instruction
includes a redundant clear of the interrupt enable bit to ensure the
CSR state updates occur.  Interrupts must stay disabled until after
the following branch to maintain the critical section used to restore
the OIC in the case that there is no interrupt to service.

The following table summarizes the machine state changes that occur at
the first {nxti}:

=== Revised C-ABI for Embedded RISC-V

The overhead to save and restore registers in the interrupt trampoline
can be reduced with a new embedded ABI that reduces the number of
caller-save registers.  Work is underway to define such an ABI, but it
is likely to require around 7 integer registers to be saved/restored
instead of 16 in the standard Unix ABI.

This will result in 18 instructions executed in the trampoline code
before arriving at the correct handler function, of which 9 are stores
(saving 7 registers plus 2 words for {epc} and {cause}).

=== Analysis of Worst-Case Interrupt Latencies for C-ABI Trampoline

The following analysis assumes a system with M-mode only and a new
embedded ABI requiring 7 caller-save registers to be saved and
restored.  For cycle timings, we assume a simple 3-stage pipeline that
has a one-cycle taken-branch or pipeline flush penalty, a one-cycle
load-use delay, and single-cycle CSR access.  This simple model
ignores effects from contention in shared memory structures, or
pipeline hazards from continuing long-latency operations in the
interrupted code.

There are several cases to consider for the worst-case latency for a
C-ABI higher-level interrupt handler that preempts lower-level code.

If an interrupt arrives while interrupts are enabled, either inside or
outside of a current handler, the processor will jump directly to
`irq_enter` at the new interrupt level.  The system must flush the
execution pipeline and then execute 18 instructions, the last of which
is the `jalr` that calls the handler function.  These 18 instructions
execute in 20 cycles using the simple pipeline model.

When interrupts are disabled, the arriving preempting handler could be
delayed.  If the preempting interrupt arrives while interrupts are
disabled during the initial entry sequence (1)--(6), there will be no
additional delay as the first {nxti} instruction (6) will cause the
higher-level interrupt handler to be invoked, replacing the original
interrupt cause.

If the preempting interrupt arrives after interrupts are disabled (15)
but before {nxti} is read (16), then the trampoline will observe the
new interrupt during execution of the {nxti} read (16), and take a
short branch back to the `service_loop`, which is lower latency than
the interrupt-disabled case.

If the preempting interrupt arrives after the read of {nxti} commits
(16), then the interrupt has to wait an additional 4 instructions
until the `mret` reenables interrupts, at which point the interrupt
will be taken and the handler entered at `irq_enter`.  In the simple
pipeline model, `mret` adds an additional pipeline flush cycle, so the
preemption latency is 20+5 cycles, which represents the worst-case for
a preempting C-ABI interrupt handler.

== Interrupt-Driven C-ABI Model

For many embedded systems, after initialization, essentially all code
is run in response to an interrupt, interrupt levels are used to
prioritize execution of different tasks, and the processor should
sleep inbetween interrupt events to save energy.

The following code can be used as the background code that runs at
interrupt level 0 and which when there is no active work to do, puts
the processor to sleep with no active context, waiting for an
interrupt using the `wfi` instruction.  The code is entered at the
`enter_loop` location and never returns directly.

[source]
----
    # Source code for interrupt-driven model background code.
sleep:
    csrrci x0, mstatus, MIE # Disable interrupts.  <1>
    wfi                     # Processor waits for next interrupt event.
    csrrsi a0, mnxti, MIE   # Gather interrupt details, and enable interrupts. <2>
    beqz a0, sleep          # Go back to sleep if no interrupt (will be preempted if SHV). <3>

service_loop: <4>
    lw a1, (a0)             # Get handler address.
    csrrsi x0, mstatus, MIE # Enable interrupts    
    jalr a1                 # Call C-ABI handler routine
    csrrsi a0, mnxti, MIE   # Claim any pending interrupt at level > 0
    bnez a0, service_loop   # Loop to service any interrupt.

    # This is also entry point to begin sleeping.
enter_sleep: <5>
    la a0, sleep
    csrci x0, mstatus, MIE  # Disable interrupts.
    #--- Interrupts disabled
    csrw mepc, a0           # Initialize mepc to point to sleep
    li a0, (MMODE)<<PP|(0)<<PIL|(1)<<PIE
    csrw mcause, a0         # Initialize mcause to have pp=M, pil=0, pie=1
    mret                    # Jump to sleep at level 0 with interrupts enabled.
    #--- Interrupts enabled
----

<1> The `sleep` loop is used to stall the processor while waiting for
work and is always entered at interrupt level 0.  Interrupts are
disabled, then a `wfi` is executed.  The `wfi` will stall the
processor until some event occurs.  When an event, including an
interrupt occurs, the `wfi` retires.  Because interrupts are disabled,
the hart does not jump to an interrupt handler but instead executes
the next instruction, avoiding context save/restore overhead.

<2> The read of {nxti} will determine if any non-SHV interrupt is
available, and if so return a pointer to the table entry.  Interrupts
are enabled by this instruction to allow SHV interrupts to be taken
via preemption.

<3> The value in `a0` checked by the branch can be zero for two
reasons. Either there was no interrupt detected or an SHV interrupt
was detected.  If there was no interrupt, the branch loops back to put
the hart to sleep.  Interrupts are enabled, so any SHV interrupt
(which all have higher interrupt level than the current interrupt
level of 0) will preempt the branch's execution and call the SHV
handler.  Once the SHV handler returns, the branch will resume and
cause execution to return back to the `sleep_loop`.

<4> The service loop is identical to that in the C-ABI interrupt
handler, except that the previous interrupt level is 0, so all pending
interrupts will be serviced in the loop before the loop exits.
Interrupts are enabled, so preemption is allowed for both C-ABI
trampoline and SHV interrupts.  When an SHV interrupt at the same or
lower interrupt level is the next to be serviced, the {nxti}
instruction will return 0 causing execution to drop out of the loop.
The following code will reinitialize the hart's interrupt level to 0,
and disable interrupts for one instruction, to ensure the SHV
interrupt will be taken.

<5> This code initializes `mepc` and `mcause` then uses an `mret` to
jump to the `sleep` loop while simultaneously reseting interrupt level
to 0 and enabling interrupts.  This is also the entry point to
initiate interrupt-driven execution.  Interrupts are enabled to allow
SHV interrupts to preempt execution on the first instruction in
`sleep` (which disables interrupts again).

This code does not increase worst-case interrupt latency over that of
the C-ABI trampoline.

== Alternate Interrupt Models for Software Vectoring

Platforms may only implement non-vectored CLIC mode
without selective hardware vectoring
(`cliccfg.nvbits=0`), in which case, hardware vectoring can be emulated
by a single software trampoline present at `NBASE` using the separate
vector table address in {tvt}.  There are several different software
approaches possible, depending on system requirements and constraints,
as detailed in following subsections.

===  `gp` Trampoline to Inline Interrupt Handlers in Single Privilege Mode

Where interrupts are known to be generated and handled in a single
privilege mode (i.e., M-mode only systems, or U-mode interrupt
handlers), a three-instruction sequence using the `gp` register to
hold the handler address can be used to indirect to an inline
interrupt handler of the type described in <<Inlines>>.

[source]
----
    # Software-vectored interrupt servicing.
    # Only safe for horizontal interrupts.
    # Must be placed three instructions back from gp.
irq_enter:
    csrrci gp, mnxti, MIE   # Overwrite gp, keep interrupts disabled.
    beqz gp, handle_exc     # Encountered exception.
    jalr gp, gp             # Recreate gp and jump to handler.
gp:                         # Must be right before system's gp location.
    # ... gp data section

    # Must be within range of beqz instruction.
handle_exc:
    # Has to recreate gp.
----

The three-instruction sequence relies on the `jalr` instruction
recreating the value in the `gp` register, which is a known constant
pointing into the middle of the global data area, by placing the
`jalr` directly before the `gp` location in memory.  The routine
jumped to by the `jalr` does not return via a `j ra` but instead ends
with an `mret`.

NOTE: This constraint on memory layout might not always be possible,
particularly if the system does not allow placing executable memory
right next to read-write memory, for example if the system does not
allow a protection boundary to be placed at 'gp' and if executable
code must not be writeable.

The code can be used with preemptible inline interrupt handlers.

=== Trampoline for Preemptible Inline Handlers 

This section describes a more general software-trampoline scheme for
calling preemptible inline handlers, which factors out the
{epc}/{cause} save code into the trampoline, and which uses a
different interrupt handler calling convention.

The interrupt handlers for this scheme have a calling convention where
there is one caller-save argument register `a0` that passes in the
handler address to distinguish different interrupt inputs, and one
temporary register `a1` that is also caller-save.  These two registers
had to be saved already by the trampoline. All other registers are
callee-save, except for the return address `ra`.  The handler normally
returns with a regular `j ra`.

----

This interrupt handler can be used together with the `wfi` sleep
background routine shown above.

== Managing Interrupt Stacks Across Privilege Modes

Interrupt handlers need to have a place to save the previous context's
state to provide working registers for the handler code.  If a handler
can be entered from a lower-privilege mode, a pointer to some safe
memory for the context save must be swapped in at entry to the
higher-privileged handler to avoid security holes. The RISC-V
privileged architecture provides the {scratch} register to hold this
information for a higher-privilege mode while executing in a
lower-privilege mode.  For the following discussion and code examples,
the assumption is that {scratch} is used to hold the
higher-privilege-mode stack pointer but other software conventions are
possible (e.g., {scratch} points to a thread context block).

Existing RISC-V ABIs allow addresses immediately below the stack
pointer to be overwritten by interrupt service routines.  The current
stack pointer in `sp` (`x2`) should be swapped with {scratch} whenever
a handler is entered from a lower-privilege mode, but should not be
swapped if entered from another handler in the same privilege mode,
including when preempting an existing interrupt handler.  At exit from
a handler, the lower-privilege stack pointer should be swapped back in
if transitioning back to the lower-privilege mode.

=== Software Privileged Stack Swap

In this convention, when code is running in a lower privilege mode,
{scratch} holds the stack pointer for the higher-privilege mode.  When
the higher-privilege mode is entered, {scratch} is set to zero to
signal to any preempting handlers that the stack pointer has already
been swapped.

The old stack pointer is saved to new stack frame before new frame is
created by bumping stack pointer, but this is done with interrupts
disabled.

    mret                       # Return from interrupt.
  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
----

This code can be used in a secure model where user-level code has one
stack, and all interrupts and exceptions are handled on a second
M-mode-only stack.  In addition, background non-handler code in M-mode
can either use the same M-mode stack as the interrupt handler, or a
separate M-mode stack.  The only difference is in the value held in
{scratch} while the M-mode background thread is running (either 0 to
indicate use the existing stack pointer in `sp` or non-zero to
indicate this stack pointer should be used in the handler.

=== Optional Scratch Swap CSR ({scratchcsw}) for Multiple Privilege Modes

The above software scheme adds 7 instructions to the interrupt code
path when preempting the same privilege mode, and adds an additional 6
instructions (13 total including two taken branches) for interrupts
from a lower-privilege mode into a higher-privileged mode.

To accelerate interrupt handling with multiple privilege modes, a new
CSR {scratchcsw} can be defined for all but the lowest privilege mode
to support conditional swapping of the {scratch} register when
transitioning between privilege modes.  The CSR instruction is used
once at the entry to a handler routine and once at handler exit, so
only adds two instructions to the interrupt code path.  Though
designed to be used with `csrrw` instructions, these CSRs can be
accessed with any CSR instruction.

For all CSR instructions accessing {scratchcsw}, the value written into
`rd` is either {scratch} if {pp} is different than the current
privilege mode, or `rs1` if {pp} is the same as the current privilege
mode.  The {scratch} register is only written if there is a privilege
mode difference, and if so, it is written obeying the usual CSR
read-modify-write conventions (e.g., swap/set/clear bits) using the
original {scratch} value as one source operand and the other source
operand specified as usual in the instruction.

In practice, only the read-modify-write (swap/CSRRW) operation is useful 
for {scratchcsw}. In contrast, the "pure read" and "pure write" 
operations are meaningless and not useful at all. The implementation of the 
non-CSRRW variants (when either `rd` or `rs1` is `x0` or when `rs1` is an immediate 
operand) on {scratchcsw} is not defined/reserved. 

NOTE: This is different than a regular CSR instruction as the value
returned is different from the value used in the read-modify-write
operation.

NOTE: The CSR instructions are defined to always copy a result
({scratch} or `rs1`) to the `rd` destination to simplify
implementations using register renaming, and in normal use the
instructions set both `rs1` = `sp` and `rd` = `sp`.

[source]
----
  csrrw rd, mscratchcsw, rs1

  // Pseudocode operation.
  if (mcause.mpp!=M-mode) then {
      t = rs1; rd = mscratch; mscratch = t;
  } else {
      rd = rs1; // mscratch unchanged.
  }

  // Usual use: csrrw sp, mscratchcsw, sp
----

NOTE: To avoid virtualization holes, software cannot directly read the
hart's current privilege mode.  The swap instruction will trap if
software tries to access a given mode's {scratchcsw} CSR from a
lesser-privileged mode, so the new CSR does not open a virtualization
hole.

==== Stack Swap Example Code

Interrupt handlers running in the lowest privilege mode do not need to
swap stack pointers, as they will only be entered by a horizontal
interrupt from the same privilege mode.  In systems with multiple
privilege modes, handlers running in higher privilege modes must
account for vertical interrupts taken from a lower privilege mode (in
which case the stack pointer must be swapped) as well as horizontal
interrupts from the same privilege mode.

In all cases, conditionally swapping the stack to account for
potential privilege-mode changes adds two extra instructions to all
interrupt handlers.

== Separating Stack per Interrupt Level

Within a single privilege mode, it can be useful to separate interrupt
handler tasks from application tasks to increase robustness, reduce
space usage, and aid in system debugging.  Interrupt handler tasks
have non-zero interrupt levels, while application tasks have an
interrupt level of zero.

=== Optional Scratch Swap CSR ({scratchcswl}) for Interrupt Levels

A new {scratchcswl} CSR is added to support faster swapping of the
stack pointer between interrupt and non-interrupt code running in the
same privilege mode.

[source]
----
  csrrw rd, mscratchcswl, rs1

  // Pseudocode operation.
  if ( (mcause.pil==0) != (mintstatus.mil==0) ) then {
      t = rs1; rd = mscratch; mscratch = t;
  } else {
      rd = rs1; // mscratch unchanged.
  }

  // Usual use: csrrw sp, mscratchcswl, sp
----

This new CSR operates similarly to {scratchcsw} except that the swap
condition is true when the interrupter and interruptee are not both
application tasks or not both interrupt handlers.

Similar to {scratchcsw}, only the read-modify-write (swap/CSRRW) operation is defined for 
{scratchcswl}. The implementation of the non-CSRRW variants (when 
either `rd` or `rs1` is `x0` or when `rs1` is an immediate operand)
on {scratchcswl} is not defined/reserved. 

== CLIC Interrupt ID ordering recommendations

There are a few CLIC interrupt ID ordering recommendations
as part of a profile and are not mandatory in all incarnations of the CLIC.

Original recommendation: 
The original basic mode interrupts retain their interrupt ID in CLIC mode.
The `clicintctl` settings are now used to delegate these interrupts as
required.

An additional CLIC software interrupt bit (csip) is provided.  This is
generally available for software use, but is usually used for the
local background interrupt thread.

CLIC interrupt inputs are allocated IDs beginning at interrupt ID 16.
Any fast local interrupts that would have been connected at interrupt
ID 16 and above should now be mapped into corresponding inputs of the
CLIC.

M-mode only or M/U mode interrupt map recommendation:
(in M-only or M/U system without N extension)
0: M-mode software interrupt
1: M-mode timer interrupt
2+: external (including legacy)

M-mode interrupt map in M/S/U system without N extension recommendation:
0: S-mode software interrupt
1: S-mode timer interrupt
2: M-mode software interrupt
3: M-mode timer interrupt
4+: external (including legacy)

Interrupt map with PLIC recommendation:
0: S-mode software interrupt
1: S-mode timer interrupt
2: S-mode external (PLIC) interrupt
3: M-mode software interrupt
4: M-mode timer interrupt
5: M-mode external (PLIC) interrupt
6: external

== CLIC Memory-mapped registers memory map considerations

The CLIC specification does not dictate how CLIC memory-mapped registers are split between M/S/U regions as well as the layout of multiple harts as this is generally a platform issue and each platform needs to define a discovery mechanism to determine the memory map locations. Some considerations for platforms to consider are selecting regions that allow for efficient PMP and virtual memory configuration.
For example, it may desired that the bases of each S/U-mode CLIC region is VM page (4k) aligned so they can be mapped through the TLBs.
