= SiFive Proposal for a RISC-V Core-Local Interrupt Controller (CLIC)
Version 20181125

== Background and Motivation

The CLIC is designed to provide low-latency, vectored, pre-emptive
interrupts for RISC-V systems.  When activated the CLIC subsumes and
replaces the existing RISC-V local interrupt scheme (CLINT).  The CLIC
design has a base design that requires minimal hardware, but supports
additional extensions to provide hardware acceleration.  The goal of
the CLIC design is to provide support for a variety of software ABI
and interrupt models, without complex hardware that can impact
high-performance processor implementations.

NOTE: While the current CLIC design provides only hart-local interrupt
control, future additions might also support directing interrupts to
harts within a core, hence the name (also CLIC sounds better than HLIC
or HIC).

=== Existing RISC-V Interrupts

The existing RISC-V interrupt system already supports interrupt
preemption, but only based on privilege mode.  At any point in time, a
RISC-V hart is running with a current privilege mode.  The global
interrupt enable bits, MIE/SIE/UIE, held in the
`mstatus`/`sstatus`/`ustatus` registers respectively, control whether
interrupts can be taken for the current or higher privilege modes;
interrupts are always disabled for lower-privileged modes.  Any
enabled interrupt from a higher-privilege mode will stop execution at
the current privilege mode, and enter the handler at the higher
privilege mode.  Each privilege mode has its own interrupt state
registers (`mepc`/`mcause` for M-mode, `sepc`/`scause` for S-mode,
`uepc`/`ucause` for U-mode with N extension) to support preemption, or
generically {epc} for privilege mode ``*_m_*``.  Preemption by a
higher-privilege-mode interrupt also pushes current privilege mode and
interrupt enable status onto the ``**__m__**pp`` and ``**__m__**pie``
stacks in the {status} register of the higher-privilege mode.

The {tvec} register specifies both the interrupt mode and the base
address of the interrupt vector table.  The low bits of the WARL
{tvec} register indicate what interrupt model is supported.  The
original settings of {tvec} mode (`*00` and `*01`) indicate use of the
CLINT model with either non-vectored or vectored transfer to a handler
function, with the 4-byte (or greater) aligned table base address held
in the upper bits of {tvec}.

NOTE: WARL means "Write Any, Read Legal" indicating that any value can
be attempted to be written but only supported values are retained.

NOTE: CLIC mode is enabled using previously reserved values (`*10` or
`*11`) in the low two bits of {tvec}.

=== CLIC versus PLIC

The standard RISC-V platform-level interrupt controller (PLIC)
provides centralized interrupt prioritization and routing for shared
platform-level interrupts, and sends only a single external interrupt
signal per privilege mode (`meip`/`seip`/`ueip`) to each hart.

The CLIC complements the PLIC.  Smaller single-core systems might have
only a CLIC, while multicore systems might have a CLIC per-core and a
single shared PLIC.  The PLIC ``**__m__**eip`` signals are treated as
hart-local interrupt sources by the CLIC at each core.

=== CLIC versus CLINT

The Core-Local Interrupt (CLINT) block was a small unit that provided
local interrupts on earlier designs, and managed the software, timer,
and external interrupt signals
(``**__m__**sip``/``**__m__**tip``/``**__m__**eip`` signals in
the {ip} register).  The CLINT also allowed additional custom
fast interrupt signals to be added in bits 16 and up of the
{ip} register.

New settings of {tvec} mode as described below are used to enable CLIC
modes instead of the original CLINT modes.  Platform profiles may
require either or both of the original CLINT and CLIC interrupt modes.

== CLIC Design

This section describes the design of the Core-Local Interrupt
Controller that receives interrupt signals and presents the next
interrupt to be processed to the processor.

=== CLIC Interrupt levels

The CLIC extends interrupt preemption to support up to 256 interrupt
levels for each privilege mode, where higher-numbered interrupt levels
can preempt lower-numbered interrupt levels.  Interrupt level 0
corresponds to regular execution outside of an interrupt handler.
Levels 1--255 correspond to interrupt handler levels. Platform
profiles will dictate how many interrupt levels must be supported.

Incoming interrupts with a higher interrupt level can preempt an
active interrupt handler running at a lower interrupt level in the
same privilege mode, provided interrupts are globally enabled in this
privilege mode.

NOTE: Existing RISC-V interrupt behavior is retained, where incoming
interrupts for a higher privilege mode can preempt an active interrupt
handler running in a lower privilege mode, regardless of global
interrupt enable in lower privilege mode.

=== CLIC Interrupt Input Control (`clicintctl`)

The CLIC design supports up to 1,024 interrupt inputs per hart, with
each interrupt input _i_ having an 8-bit memory-mapped WARL
control register, `clicintctl[__i__]`.  The first 16 interrupt
inputs are reserved for the CLINT interrupts present in the low 16 bits
of the {ip} and {ie} registers, so up to 1,008 local external
interrupts can be added.

A fixed parameter of the CLIC (`CLICINTCTLBITS`) is how many total bits
are present in the `clicintctl` registers , with 2 {lt}=
`CLICINTCTLBITS` {lt}= 8.  The implemented bits are kept left-justified
in the most-significant bits of each 8-bit `clicintctl[__i__]`
register, with the lower unimplemented bits treated as hardwired to 1.
These configuration bits are interpreted as mode, level, and
priority depend on the setting of the `cliccfg` register as
described below.

Each interrupt input also has an orthogonal interrupt-enable bit
(`clicintie[i]`) as well as an interrupt-pending bit (`clicintip[i]`)
in the memory map.  For level-sensitive hardware interrupts, the
interrupt-pending bits are read-only.

The CLIC circuitry treats the `clicintctl` values as unsigned
integers, and takes a global maximum across all pending-and-enabled
`clicintctl` values to select the interrupt to present to the core.
The `cliccfg` setting then determines how to split the maximum
`clicintctl` value into privilege mode (M/S/U), interrupt level
(0--255), and interrupt priority (0--255).

WARNING: Selecting an interrupt level of 0 for a high privilege mode
disables the interrupt, but also masks any interrupt at a lower
privilege mode since the higher-privilege mode causes the interrupt
signal to appear more urgent than any lower-privilege mode interrupt.

NOTE: On a multithreaded core, the `clicintctl[__i__]` register might
also contain a hart-id field to direct the interrupt to one hart on
the core.  This multithreaded option is not discussed further in this
proposal.

==== Interrupt Input Cause Codes

The 1024 CLIC interrupt vectors are given unique {cause} `exccode`
values.  The original CLINT interrupts retain their original cause
values, while the new interrupts are numbered starting at 16.

NOTE: When upgrading an earlier CLINT-based system design that had
local interrupts attached directly to bits 16 and above, these local
interrupts can be now attached as CLIC inputs 16 and above to retain
the same interrupt IDs.

=== CLIC configuration (`cliccfg`)

The CLIC has a single memory-mapped 6-bit global configuration
register, `cliccfg`, that defines how the `clicintctl[__i__]`
registers are subdivided into mode, level, and priority fields, which
are held in descending order from the most-significant to the
least-significant bits of each `clicintctl` register.  The lowest
variable bit in the `clicintctl[__i__]` field can also be used to
control whether interrupt _i_ uses hardware vectoring.

The `cliccfg` register has three WARL fields, a 2-bit `nmbits` field,
a 4-bit `nlbits` field, and a 1-bit `nvbits` field, plus a reserved
bit WARL-hardwired to zero in current spec.

----

The `cliccfg` register resets to 0 (i.e., all interrupts are M-mode at
level 255).

==== Specifying interrupt privilege mode

NOTE: Figure out interaction with hypervisor mode.

The 2-bit `cliccfg.nmbits` WARL field encodes how many bits in a
`clicintctl[__i__]` register are used to hold an input __i__'s
privilege mode.

M-mode-only systems do not support privilege-mode fields in the
`clicintctl` registers (`cliccfg.nmbits` = 0).

M/U-mode systems with user-level interrupts support `cliccfg.nmbits` =
0 or 1.  If `cliccfg.nmbits` = 0, then all interrupts are treated as
M-mode interrupts.  If the `cliccfg.nmbits` = 1, then a value of 1 in
the MSB of an `clicintctl[__i__]` register indicates that interrupt
intput is taken in M-mode, while a value of 0 indicates that interrupt
is taken in U-mode.

M/S/U-mode systems support 0, 1, or 2 bits of privilege-mode field.
`cliccfg.nmbits` = 0 indicates that all local interrupts are taken in
M-mode.  `cliccfg.nmbits` = 1 indicates that the MSB selects between M-mode
(1) and S-mode (0).  `cliccfg.nmbits` = 2 indicates that the two MSBs of
each `clicintctl[__i__]` register encode the interrupt's privilege mode using the
same encoding as the `mstatus.mpp` field.

==== Specifying interrupt level

The 4-bit `cliccfg.nlbits` WARL field indicates how many bits
immediately below the `cliccfg.nmbits` privilege-mode bits encode the
level at which the interrupt is taken.  Valid values are 0--8.

If the `nmbits + nlbits` {gt} `CLICINTCTLBITS`, then the lower bits of
the 8-bit interrupt level are assumed to be all 1s.  If `nlbits` {lt}
8, then the lower bits of the 8-bit interrupt level are assumed to be
all 1s.  The following table shows how levels are encoded in either of
these two cases.

----
 #bits   encoding          interrupt levels
     1    l.......                        127,                            255

 "l" bits are available variable bits in level specification
 "." bits are non-existent bits for level encoding, assumed to be 1
----

If `nlbits` = 0, then all interrupts are treated as level 255.

Examples of `cliccfg` settings:

 CLICINTCTLBITS nmbits nlbits clicintctl[i] interrupt levels
       2         2       2      mm......     255
       3         2       2      mml.....     127,255
       4         2       2      mmll....     63,127,191,255
       5         2       3      mmlll...     31,63,95,127,159,191,223,255
       5         1       1      mlppp...     127,255

==== Specifying interrupt priority

The least-significant bits in `clicintctl[__i__]` that are not
configured to be part of the mode or level are used to prioritize
among interrupts pending-and-enabled at the same privilege mode and
interrupt level. The highest-priority interrupt at a given privilege
mode and interrupt level is taken first.  In case there are multiple
pending-and-enabled interrupts at the same highest priority, the
highest-numbered interrupt is taken first.

NOTE: The highest numbered interrupt wins in a tie.  This is the same
as the original CLINT, but different than the PLIC.

Any implemented priority bits are treated as the most-significant bits
of a 8-bit unsigned integer with lower unimplemented bits set to 1.
For example, with one priority bit (`p111_1111`), interrupts can be
set to have priorities 127 or 255, and with two priority bits
(`pp11_1111`), interrupts can be set to have priorities 63, 127, 191,
or 255.

==== Specifying selective interrupt hardware vectoring

The single-bit WARL `nvbits` field in `cliccfg` enables or disables
selective interrupt hardware vectoring.

If `nvbits` = 0, then selective interrupt vectoring is turned off, and
all interrupts are vectored according to the mode setting held in the
low bits of {tvec}.  The {tvec} register is used to specify the
handler PC for non-vectored CLIC mode.  A separate {tvt} CSR holds the
base address of a table of trap-handler function pointers used when
{tvec} is set to hardware-vectored CLIC mode.  The same {tvt} CSR
provides the table base address for selective hardware vectoring and
for software vectoring using the {nxti} CSR.

If `nvbits` = 1, then selective interrupt vectoring is turned on.  The
least-significant implemented bit of `clicintctl[__i__]` (i.e.,
`clicinfcfg[__i__][8-CLICINTCTLBITS]`) controls the vectoring behavior of
interrupt _i_.  If the relevant bit of `clicintctl[__i__]` is 0, then
behavior follows the default specified by {tvec}.  If the relevant bit
of `clicintctl[__i__]` is 1, then the interrupt is hardware vectored
independent of the settings of {tvec}.  This allows some interrupts to
all jump to a common base address held in {tvec}, while the others are
vectored in hardware via a table pointed to by the additional {tvt}
CSR.

NOTE: Selective hardware vectoring is intended to be used with the
non-vectored CLIC mode.  Selective hardware vectoring has no effect if
the base mode is hardware vectoring.

NOTE: We could alternatively have `clicintctl[__i__][8-CLICINTCTLBITS]`
invert the vectoring setting for input _i_.

NOTE: The setting of `nvbits` does not alter the way in which the
implemented `clicintctl[__i__]` bits are interpreted as mode, level,
or priority.  The encoding means that selectively hardware-vectored (SHV)
interrupts are always handled before non-hardware-vectored interrupts
with identical settings in the other upper bits of
`clicintctl[__i__]`.  The assumption is that this is usually the
desired behavior.  Additional `cliccfg` bits could specify different
treatment of the hardware vectoring bits (e.g., ignoring the vectoring
bit in priority calculation, or inverting the encoding to handle
non-vectored before vectored).

Examples:

 CLICINTCTLBITS nmbits nlbits nvbits clicintctl[i] Vectored?
       2         2       2      1    mm......      M/S-mode interrupts
       3         2       2      1    mml.....      Level 255
       4         2       2      1    mmll....      Levels 127, 255
       5         2       3      1    mmlll...      Levels 63,127,191,255
       5         1       1      1    mlppp...      Priorities 63,127,191,255

=== CLIC interaction with other local interrupts

The CLIC subsumes the functionality of the fast local interrupts
previously provided in bits 16 and up of {ip}/{ie}, so these are no
longer visible in {ip}/{ie}.

The existing timer (`mtip`/`stip`/`utip`), software
(`msip`/`ssip`/`usip`), and external interrupt inputs
(`meip`/`seip`/`ueip`) are treated as additional local interrupt
sources, where the privilege mode, interrupt level, and priority can
be altered using memory-mapped `clicintctl[__i__]` registers.  For
each of
`meip`/`mtip`/`msip`/`seip`/`stip`/`ssip`/`ueip`/`utip`/`usip`, an
8-bit configuration register is provided, which follows the format of
the above.

NOTE: In CLIC mode, interrupt delegation for these signals is achieved
via changing the interrupt's privilege mode in the CLIC interrupt
input configuration, as with any other CLIC interrupt input.

== CLIC CSRs

This section describes the CLIC-related hart-specific CSRs. When in
CLINT mode, the behavior is intended to be software compatible with
CLINT-only systems.

The interrupt-handling CSRs are listed below, with changes and
additions for CLIC mode described in the following sections.

----

=== Changes to {status} CSRs

When in CLINT mode, the {status} register behavior is unchanged (i.e.,
backwards-compatible with CLINT mode).  When in CLIC mode, the
``**__m__**pp`` and ``**__m__**pie`` in {status} are now accessible
via fields in the {cause} register.

=== Changes to Delegation ({edeleg}/{ideleg}) CSRs

In CLIC mode, the CLIC input configuration `clcintcfg[__i__]`
specifies the privilege mode in which each interrupt should be taken,
so the {ideleg} CSR ceases to have effect in CLIC mode.  The {ideleg}
CSR is still accessible and state bits retain their values when
switching between CLIC and CLINT modes.

Exception delegation specified by {edeleg} functions the same in CLIC
mode as in CLINT mode.

=== Changes to {ie}/{ip} CSRs

The {ie} CSR appears hardwired to zero in CLIC mode, replaced by separate
memory-mapped interrupt enables (`clicintie[__i__]`).

The {ip} CSR appears hardwired to zero in CLIC mode, replaced by
separate memory-mapped interrupt pendings (`clicintip[__i__]`).

In systems that support both CLINT and CLIC modes, the state bits in
{ie} and {ip} retain their value when switching between modes.

=== New {tvec} CSR modes

The new interrupt-handling modes are encoded as new states in the
existing {tvec} WARL register, where the low two bits of {tvec} are
`10` or `11`.  In these modes, the trap vector base address held in
{tvec} is constrained to be aligned on a 64-byte or larger
power-of-two boundary.

----
 mtvec   Action on Interrupt
 aaaa00  pc := OBASE                (original non-vectored CLINT mode)
 aaaa01  pc := OBASE + 4 * exccode      (original vectored CLINT mode)
 000010  pc := NBASE                          (non-vectored CLIC mode)
 000011  pc := M[TBASE + XLEN/8 * exccode)] & ~1  (vectored CLIC mode)
 xxxx1?  (xxxx!=0000)                            Reserved

 OBASE = mtvec[XLEN-1:2]<<2 # Original vector base was at least 4-byte aligned.
 NBASE = mtvec[XLEN-1:6]<<6 # New vector base is at least 64-byte aligned.
 TBASE = mtvt[XLEN-1:6]<<6  # Trap vector table base is at least 64-byte aligned.
----

Writing a value to {tvec} with the low two bits `10` selects a
non-vectored CLIC mode, where the processor jumps to the
trap handler address held in the upper XLEN-6 bits of
{tvec} for all exceptions and interrupts in privilege mode
`**__m__**`.

Writing a value to {tvec} with the low two bits `11` selects vectored
CLIC mode.  In vectored CLIC mode, on an interrupt, the processor
switches to the handler's privilege mode and sets the hardware
vectoring bit {inhv} in {cause}, then fetches an XLEN-bit handler
address from the in-memory table whose base address (TBASE) is in
{tvt}.  The trap handler function address is fetched from
`TBASE+XLEN/8*exccode`.  If the fetch is successful, the processor
clears the low bit of the handler address, sets the PC to this handler
address, then clears the {inhv} bit in {cause}.  The overall effect
is:

     pc := M[TBASE + XLEN/8 * exccode] & ~1

[source]

           # Vector table layout for RV32 (4-byte function pointers)
  mtvt ->  0x800000 # Interrupt 0 handler function pointer
           0x800004 # Interrupt 1 handler function pointer
           0x800008 # Interrupt 2 handler function pointer
           0x80000c # Interrupt 3 handler function pointer

           # Vector table layout for RV64 (8-byte function pointers)

           0x800008 # Interrupt 1 handler function pointer
           0x800010 # Interrupt 2 handler function pointer
           0x800018 # Interrupt 3 handler function pointer
----

NOTE: The original CLINT vectored mode simply jumped to an address in
the trap vector table, while the new CLIC vectored mode reads a
handler function address from the table, and jumps to it in hardware.

NOTE: This version of the proposal has dropped the previously proposed
instruction encoding for the trap handler vector addresses, as it
complicated static initialization in C.  The entries in the table are
simple XLEN-bit function pointers.

NOTE: The hardware vectoring bit {inhv} is provided to allow resumable
traps on fetches to the trap vector table.

Implementations might support only one of CLINT or CLIC mode.  If only
CLINT mode is supported, writes to bit 1 are ignored and it’s always
set to zero (current behavior).  If only CLIC mode is supported,
writes to bit 1 are also ignored and it’s always set to one.  CLIC
mode hardwires {tvec} bits 2-5 to zero (assuming no further CLIC
extensions are supported).

For permissions-checking purposes, the memory access to retrieve the
function pointer for vectoring is treated as a load with the privilege
mode of the interrupt handler.  If there is an access exception on the
table load, {epc} holds the faulting address.  If this was a page
fault, the table load can be resumed by returning with {epc} pointing
to the table entry and the trap handler mode bit set.

Instruction fetch at the handler address might cause misaligned or
access exceptions, which are reported with {epc} containing the
faulting instruction fetch address.

In both vectored and non-vectored CLIC modes, synchronous exception
traps always jump to NBASE.

=== New {tvt} CSR

The {tvt} WARL XLEN-bit CSR holds the base address of the trap vector
table, aligned on a 64-byte or greater power-of-two boundary.  Values
other than 0 in the low 6 bits of {tvt} are reserved.

In systems that support both CLINT and CLIC modes, the {tvt} CSR is
still accessible in CLINT mode (but does not have any effect).

NOTE: A previous proposal used positive and negative offsets from
{tvec} to point at the shared trampoline code and the trap vector
table respectively, but this imposed a hard constraint on memory
layout, which would be problematic when the trampoline code would
prefer to be in flash/ROM while the writable vector table should be in
SRAM. The {tvt} CSR allows the trampoline code and the trap vector
table to be independently located in the system memory map.

=== Changes to {epc} CSRs

The {epc} CSRs behave the same in both modes, capturing the PC at
which execution was interrupted.

=== Changes to {cause} CSRs

In both CLINT and CLIC modes, the {cause} CSR is written at the time an
interrupt or synchronous trap is taken, recording the reason for the
interrupt or trap.  For CLIC mode, {cause} is also extended to record
more information about the interrupted context, which is used to
reduce the overhead to save and restore that context for an {ret}
instruction. CLIC mode {cause} also adds state to record progress
through the trap handling process.

 23:16  mpil[7:0]    Previous interrupt level
 15:10  (reserved)
   9:0  Exccode[9:0] Exception/interrupt code

The `mcause.mpp` and `mcause.mpie` fields mirror the `mstatus.mpp` and
`mstatus.mpie` fields, and are aliased into `mcause` to reduce context
save/restore code.

If the hart is currently running at some privilege mode (`pp`) at some
interrupt level (`pil`) and an enabled interrupt becomes pending at
any interrupt level in a higher privilege mode or if an interrupt at a
higher interrupt level in the current privilege mode becomes pending
and interrupts are globally enabled in this privilege mode, then
execution is immediately transferred to a handler running with the new
interrupt's privilege mode (`**__m__**`) and interrupt level (`il`).

The CSR {epc} is set to the PC of the interrupted application
code or preempted interrupt handler, while the {cause}
register now captures the previous privilege mode (`pp`), interrupt
level (`pil`) and interrupt enable (`pie`), as well as the id of the
interrupt in `exccode`.

In systems supporting both CLINT and CLIC modes, the new CLIC-specific
fields (`minhv`, `mpp`, `mpil`, `mpie`) appear to be hardwired to zero
in CLINT mode for backwards compatibilty.  When CLINT mode is written
to {tvec}, the new {cause} state fields (`mhinv` and `mpil`) are
zeroed.  The other new {cause} fields, `mpp` and `mpie`, appear as
zero in the {cause} CSR but the corresponding state bits in the
`mstatus` register are not cleared.

The supervisor `scause` register has only a single `spp` bit (to
indicate user/supervisor) mirrored from `sstatus.spp`, while the user
`ucause` register has no `upp` bit as interrupts can only have come
from user mode.

=== Next Interrupt Handler Address and Interrupt-Enable CSR ({nxti})

The {nxti} CSR can be used by software to service the next horizontal
interrupt for the same privilege mode when it has greater level than
the saved interrupt context (held in {cause}`.pil`), without incuring
the full cost of an interrupt pipeline flush and context save/restore.
The {nxti} CSR is designed to be accessed using CSRRSI/CSRRCI
instructions, where the value read is a pointer to an entry in the
trap handler table and the write back updates the interrupt-enable
status. In addition, accesses to the {nxti} have side-effects that
update the interrupt context state.

NOTE: This is different than a regular CSR instruction as the value
returned is different from the value used in the read-modify-write
operation.

A read of the {nxti} CSR returns either zero, indicating there is no
suitable interrupt to service or that the highest ranked interrupt is
SHV or that the system is not in a CLIC mode, or returns a non-zero
address of the entry in the trap handler table for software trap
vectoring.

NOTE: The {tvt} CSR could be set to memory addresses such that a table
entry was at address zero, and this would be indistinguishable from
the no-interrupt case.

If the CSR instruction that acccesses {nxti} includes a write, the
{status} CSR is the one used for the read-modify-write portion of the
operation, while the {cause} register's `exccode` field and the
{intstatus} register's `**__m__**il` field can also be updated with
the new interrupt id and level respectively.

NOTE: Following the usual convention for CSR instructions, if the CSR
instruction does not include write side effects (e.g., `csrr t0,
mnxti`), then no state update on any CSR occurs.  This can be used to
determine if an interrupt could be taken without actually updating
{il} and `exccode`.

The {nxti} CSR is intended to be used inside an interrupt handler
after an initial interrupt has been taken and {cause} and {epc}
registers updated with the interrupted context and the id of the
interrupt.

[source]
--
 // Pseudo-code for csrrsi rd, mnxti, uimm[4:0] in M mode.
 mstatus |= uimm[4:0]; // Performed regardless of interrupt readiness.
 if (clic.priv==M && clic.level > mcause.pil
     && (cliccfg.nvbits==0 || clicintctl[clic.id][8-CLICINTCTLBITS]==0) ) {
   // The CLIC interrupt should be serviced before returning to the saved context,
   // unless it's a selectively hardware vectored interupt.
   mintstatus.mil = clic.level; // Update hart's interrupt level.
   mcause.exccode = clic.id;   // Update interrupt id.
   rd = TBASE + XLEN/8 * clic.id; // Return pointer to trap handler entry.
 } else {
   // No interrupt, or a selectively hardware vectored interrupt, or in non-CLIC mode.
   rd = 0;
 }
--

NOTE: Vertical interrupts to different privilege modes will be taken
preemptively by the hardware, so {nxti} effectively only ever handles
the next interrupt in the same privilege mode.

In CLINT mode, reads of {nxti} return 0, updates to {status} proceed
as in CLIC mode, but updates to {intstatus} and {cause} do not take
effect.

=== New Interrupt status ({intstatus}) CSR

A new M-mode CSR, `mintstatus`, holds the active interrupt level for
each supported privilege mode.  These fields are read-only.  The
primary reason to expose these fields is to support debug.

 mintstatus fields
 31:24 mil
 23:16 (reserved) # To follow pattern of others.
 15: 8 sil
  7: 0 uil

Corresponding supervisor mode, `sintstatus`, and user, `uintstatus`,
provide restricted views of mintstatus.

 sintstatus fields
 31:16 (reserved)
 15: 8 sil
  7: 0 uil

 uintstatus fields
 31: 8 (reserved)
  7: 0 uil

The {intstatus} registers are accessible in CLINT mode for system that
support both modes.

== CLIC Interrupt Operation

This section describes the operation of CLIC interrupts.

=== General interrupt overview

At any time, a hart is running in some privilege mode with some
interrupt level.  The hart's privilege mode is held internally in the
processor but is not visible to software running on a hart (to avoid
virtualization holes), but the current interrupt level is made visible
in the {intstatus} register.  Interrupt level 0 corresponds to regular
execution outside of an interrupt handler.

Within a privilege mode `*_m_*`, if the associated global
interrupt-enable {ie} is clear, then no interrupts will be taken in
that privilege mode, but a pending-enabled interrupt in a higher
privilege mode will preempt current execution.  If {ie} is set, then
pending-enabled interrupts at a higher interrupt level in the same
privilege mode will preempt current execution and run the interrupt
handler for the higher interrupt level.

As with the existing RISC-V mechanism, when an interrupt or
synchronous exception is taken, the privilege mode and interrupt level
are modified to reflect the new privilege mode and interrupt level.
The global interrupt-enable bit of the handler's privilege mode is
cleared, to prevent preemption by higher-level interrupts in the same
privilege mode.

The overall behavior is summarized in the following table: the Current
`p/ie/il` fields represent the current privilege mode `P` (not
software visible), interrupt enable in {status} `ie` and interrupt
level `L` in {intstatus}; the CLIC `priv`,`level`, and `id` fields
represent the highest-ranked interrupt currently present in the CLIC
with `nP` representing the new privilege mode, `nL` representing the
new interrupt level, and `id` representing the interrupt's id;
Current' shows the `p/ie/il` context in the handler's privilege mode;
`pc` represents the program counter with `V` representing the result
of any hardware vectoring; `cde` represents the {cause} `exccode`
field; while the Previous `pp/il/ie/epc` columns represent previous
context fields in {cause} and {epc}.

 Current  |      CLIC          |->      Current'          Previous
 p/ie/il  | priv level   id    |->    p/ie/il  pc  cde   pp/il/ie epc
 P  ?  ?  | nP<P     ?      ?  |->    - -  -   -   -     -  -  -  -   # Interrupt ignored
 P  0  ?  | nP=P     ?      ?  |->    - -  -   -   -     -  -  -  -   # Interrupts disabled
 P  1  ?  | nP=P     0      ?  |->    - -  -   -   -     -  -  -  -   # No interrupt
 P  1  L  | nP=P   0<nL<=L  ?  |->    - -  -   -   -     -  -  -  -   # Interrupt ignored
 P  1  L  | nP=P   L<nL    id  |->    P 0  nL  V   id    P  L  1  pc  # Horizontal interrupt taken
 P  ?  ?  | nP>P     0      ?  |->    - -  -   -   -     -  -  -  -   # No interrupt
 P  e  L  | nP>P   0<nL    id  |->   nP 0  nL  V   id    P  L  e  pc  # Vertical interrupt taken

=== Critical Sections in Interrupt Handlers

To implement a critical section between interrupt handlers at
different levels in the same privilege mode, an interrupt handler at
any interrupt level can clear the mode's global interrupt-enable bit,
{ie}, to prevent any interrupts with the same privilege mode from
being taken.

NOTE: Need to specify a way to set an interrupt-level threshold, to
more selectively disable preemption.

=== Synchronous Exception Handling

Horizontal synchronous exception traps, which stay within a privilege
mode, are serviced with the same interrupt level as the instruction
that raised the exception.

WARNING: The synchronous trap will overwrite the {epc} and {cause}
values, so exceptions causing horizontal traps should generally be
avoided in interrupt handlers.

Vertical synchronous exception traps, which are serviced at a higher
privilege mode, are taken at interrupt level 0 in the higher privilege
mode.

WARNING: Vertical synchronous trap handlers should avoid causing
horizontal traps, as these will overwrite {epc} and {cause}.

=== Returns from Handlers

The regular {ret} instructions are used to return from handlers in
privilege mode `*_m_*`.  Execution continues at the saved privilege
mode `**__m__**cause.**__m__**pp`, at PC {epc}, with interrupt level
`**__m__**cause.**__m__**pil`, and with the global interrupt enable
for the restored mode as `**__m__**cause.**__m__**pie`.

The {ret} instruction does not modify the
`**__m__**cause.**__m__**pil` field in {cause}.  The
`**__m__**cause.**__m__**pp` and `**__m__**cause.**__m__**pie` fields
are modified following the behavior previously defined for
`**__m__**status.**__m__**pp` and `**__m__**status.**__m__**pie`
respectively.

== Interrupt Handling Software

=== Interrupt Stack Software Conventions

The CLIC supports multiple nested interrupt handlers, and each handler
requires some working registers. To make registers available, each
handler typically saves and restores registers from the interrupted
context on a memory-resident stack.  In addition, the memory-resident
stack is used to hold other interrupted context information, such as
{epc} and {cause}, which are required by the {ret} instruction.

The standard RISC-V ABI convention is that stacks grow downwards, and
that memory addresses below the current stack pointer can be
dynamically altered by another agent, such as an interrupt handler.

When interrupts are taken horizontally within the same privilege mode,
the interrupt handler may be able to use the same stack as the
interrupted thread, by allocating a new stack frame below the current
stack pointer.

When interrupts are taken vertically into a higher privilege mode, the
stack pointer must be swapped to a stack within the higher privilege
mode to avoid a security hole.  The {scratch} registers can be used to
hold the stack pointer of a higher-privilege mode while
lower-privilege code is executing, or {scratch} can be used to point
to more extensive thread-local context that might contain a stack
pointer.

[[inline-section,Inlines]]
=== Inline interrupt handlers and "interrupt attribute" for C

Inline interrupt handlers are small leaf functions that handle simple
interrupts.  To provide easy C coding for inline interrupt handlers,
while reducing register save/restore overhead, we use standard
interrupt attributes, which have the following syntax:

[source]
----
  /* Small ISR to poke device to clear interrupt and increment in-memory counter. */
  void __attribute__ ((interrupt))
  foo (void)
  {
    extern volatile int INTERRUPT_FLAG;
    INTERRUPT_FLAG = 0;
    extern volatile int COUNTER;
  #ifdef __riscv_atomic
    __atomic_fetch_add (&COUNTER, 1, __ATOMIC_RELAXED);
  #else
    COUNTER++;
  #endif
  }
----

The attribute tells the C compiler to use callee-save for all
registers, so the handler has to "pay as it goes" to use registers,
and only save the full caller-save set if it makes a nested regular C
call.  The attribute also tells the C compiler to align the function
entry point on an 8-byte boundary.

[source]
----
   .align 3
      # Inline non-preemptible interrupt handler.
      # Only safe for horizontal interrupts.
   foo:
      addi sp, sp, -FRAMESIZE      # Create a frame on stack.
      sw a0, OFFSET(sp)            # Save working register.
      sw x0, INTERRUPT_FLAG, a0    # Clear interrupt flag.
      sw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Save working register.
      la a0, COUNTER               # Get counter address.
      li a1, 1
      amoadd.w x0, (a0), a1        # Increment counter in memory.
      lw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Restore registers.
      lw a0, OFFSET(sp)
      addi sp, sp, FRAMESIZE       # Free stack frame.
      mret                         # Return from handler using saved mepc.
----

With hardware vectoring, inline interrupt handlers can provide very
rapid response for small tasks.

NOTE: The above entire handler executes in 13 instructions.  The
`INTERRUPT_FLAG` store and the `la` require two instructions each to
build up a global address.  A simple pipeline would encounter two
pipeline flushes (on entry and on exit), plus the cycles taken to fetch
the hardware vector entry.

These inline handlers can be used with the original CLINT design as
well as the new CLIC design.

To take advantage of hardware preemption in the new CLIC design,
inline handlers must save and restore {epc} and {cause} before
enabling interrupts:

[source]
----
   .align 3
      # Inline preemptible interuppt handler.
      # Only safe for horizontal interrupts.
   foo:
      #----- Interrupts disabled on entry ---#
      addi sp, sp, -FRAMESIZE      # Create a frame on stack.
      sw a0, OFFSET(sp)            # Save working register.
      csrr a0, mcause              # Read cause.
      sw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Save working register.
      csrr a1, mepc                # Read epc.
      csrrsi x0, mstatus, MIE      # Enable interrupts.
      #----- Interrupts enabled ---------#
      sw a0, OFFSET(sp)            # Save cause on stack.
      sw x0, INTERRUPT_FLAG, a0    # Clear interrupt flag.
      sw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Save epc on stack.
      la a0, COUNTER               # Get counter address.
      li a1, 1
      amoadd.w x0, (a0), a1        # Increment counter in memory.
      lw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Restore epc
      lw a0, OFFSET(sp)            # Restore cause
      csrrci x0, mstatus, MIE      # Disable interrupts.
      #----- Interrupts disabled  ---------#
      csrw mepc, a1                # Put epc back.
      lw a1, OFFSET(sp)            # Restore a1.
      csrw mcause, a0              # Put cause back.
      lw s0, OFFSET(sp)            # Restore s0.
      addi sp, sp, FRAMESIZE       # Free stack frame.
      mret                         # Return from handler.
      #------------------------------------#
----

NOTE: This version requires 10 more instructions, but reduces the time
a preempting interrupt has to wait from a 13-instruction window to a
6-instruction window (the instruction that disables interrupts can be
preempted before committing).

WARNING: This form cannot be used with the existing CLINT scheme,
unless the original interrupt pending signal is cleared before
re-enabling interrupts.

== Calling C-ABI functions as Interrupt Handlers

An alternative model is where all interrupt handler routines use the
standard C ABI.  In this case, the CLIC would use no hardware
vectoring for the C ABI handlers and instead use a common software
trampoline, which uses the {nxti} instruction to obtain the
trap-handler address.  The code sequence below is annotated with an
explanation of its operation.

=== C-ABI Trampoline Code

[source]
----
  # Example Unix C ABI interrupt trampoline.
  # Only safe for horizontal interrupts.
  # FRAMESIZE should be defined appropriately to hold saved context with ABI-specified alignment.
  # OFFSET should be replaced with individual stack frame locations.
  # Register save/restore pseudo-code should be expanded to individual instructions.

----

<1> An initial interrupt (II) causes entry to the handler with
interrupts disabled, and {epc} and {cause} CSRs hold values
representing the original interrupted context (OIC), including the PC
in {epc}, the privilege mode in {pp} (visible in both {cause} and
{status}), the interrupt level in {pil} (in {cause}) and the interrupt
enable state in {pie} (visible in both {cause} and {status}).  The
{cause} CSR and the {intstatus} CSRs additionally hold information on
the interrupt to be handled, including `exccode` in {cause} and {il}
in {intstatus}.

<2> The interrupt trampoline needs sufficient space to store the OIC's
caller-save registers as well as its `epc` and `cause` values, which
are saved in a frame on the memory stack to support preemption.  This
routine is M-mode only so does not need to consider swapping stacks
from other privilege modes.  A simple constant bump of the stack
pointer `sp` is sufficient to provide space to store the OIC.

<3> The trap handler could have been entered by a synchronous
exception instead of an interrupt, which can be determined by
examining the sign bit of the returned {cause} value.  If the trap was
for an exception (sign bit zero), the code jumps to exception handler
code while keeping interrupts disabled.

<4> The exception handler code is located here out of line to reduce
performance impact on interrupts.  The main body of the trampoline
only handles interrupts.

<5> If this was an interrupt, the trampoline entry code continues to
save all the caller-save registers to the stack.  This is done with
interrupts disabled, as even if an interrupt arrived with a higher
interrupt level it would still require all registers to be saved.

<6> When {nxti} is read here, the interrupt inputs to the CLIC might
have changed from the time the handler was initially entered.  The
return value of {nxti}, which holds a pointer to an entry in the trap
vector table, is saved in register `a0` so it can be passed as the
first argument to the software-vectored interrupt handler, where it
can be used to reconstruct the original interrupt id in the case where
multiple vector entries use a common handler.  There are multiple
cases to consider, all of which are handled correctly by the
definition of {nxti}:

* The II is still the ranking interrupt (no change).  In this case, as
the level of the II will still be higher than `pil` from the OIC, {il}
and `exccode` will be rewritten with the same value that they already
had (effectively unchanged), and {nxti} will return the table entry
for the II.

* The II has been superceded by a higher-level non-SHV interrupt.  In
this case, {il} will be set to the new higher interrupt level,
`exccode` will be updated to the new interrupt id, and {nxti} will
return the vector table entry for the new higher-level interrupt.  The
OIC is not disturbed, retaining the original `epc` and the original
`pil`.  This case reduces latency to service a more-important
interrupt that arrives after the state-save sequence was begun for the
less-important II.  The II, if still pending-enabled, will be serviced
sometime after the higher-level interrupt as described below.

* The II has been superceded by a higher-priority non-SHV interrupt at
the same level.  This operates similarly to the previous case, with
`exccode` updated to the new interrupt id.  Because the lower-priority
interrupt had not begun to run its service routine, this optimization
preserves the property that interrupt handlers at the same interrupt
level but different priorities execute atomically with respect to each
other (i.e., they do not preempt each other).

* The II has disappeared and a lower-ranked non-SHV interrupt, which
has interrupt level greater than the OIC's `pil` is present in CLIC.
In this case, the {il} of the handler will be reduced to the
lower-ranked interrupt's level, `exccode` will be updated with the new
interrupt id, and {nxti} will return a pointer to the appropriate
handler in table.  In this case, the new lower-ranked interrupt would
still have caused the original context to have been interrupted to run
the handler, and the disappearing II has simply caused the
lower-ranked interrupt's entry and state-save sequence to begin
earlier.

* The II has disappeared and either there is no current interrupt from
the CLIC, or the current ranking interrupt is a non-SHV interrupt with
level lower than {pil}.  In this case, the {il} and `exccode` are not
updated, and 0 is returned by {nxti}.  The following trampoline code
will then not fetch a vector from the table, and instead just restore
the OIC context and `mret` back to it.  This preserves the property
that the OIC completes execution before servicing any new interrupt
with a lower or equal interrupt level.

* The II has been superceded by a higher-level SHV interrupt.  In this
case, the {il} and `exccode` are not updated, and 0 is returned by
{nxti}.  Once interrupts are reenabled for the following instruction,
the processor will preempt the current handler and execute the vectored
interrupt at a higher interrupt level using the function pointer
stored in the vector table.

<7> Interrupts are now enabled.  If a higher-level SHV interrupt had
arrived while interrupts were disabled, then the current handler will
be preempted and execution starts at the SHV handler address.  If a
non-vectored higher-level interrupt arrives now, it will also preempt
the current handler and begin a nested state-save sequence at the
handler entry point `irq_enter`.

<8> The branch checks if the II disappeared or if a higher priority
SHV at the same level appeared, in which case the current handler
returns to the OIC.  As most registers have not been touched, the
routine can skip past most of the register restore code.  This
preserves the property that interrupts (SHV or non-SHV) at the same
level do not preempt each other.

<9> The value returned by {nxti} is used to index the vector table and
return the function pointer.

<10> This `csrrsi` instruction enables interrupts and is redundant
when proceeding sequentially from the first {nxti} read (6) or if
looping back from the end of the `service_loop` (13).  However, it is
required on the backward path from (16) to re-enable interrupts to
allow preemption.  It is scheduled after the table lookup to use what
will often be a load-use delay slot.

<11> The `jalr` instruction actually calls the C ABI function that
implements the handler.  Interrupts are enabled at this point, so the
C function can be preempted at any time by an interrupt with a higher
level than current {il}.

<12> Once the handler returns, another read of {nxti} checks if there
are any more interrupts to service.  Interrupts remain enabled.  The
`csrrsi` includes a redundant set of the {ie} interrupt enable to
force the CSR instruction to update CSR state.  Only non-SHV
interrupts with a level greater than `pil` will be serviced in this
loop.  Note that {il} can decrease from its current value on the
{nxti} read.  {il} should not increase in this code, as interrupts are
enabled here and if a higher-level interrupt was ready, it should have
preempted this instruction.

<13> If there was another appropriate interrupt to service, the code
loops back to perform the next handler call.  The `service_loop` only
contains 5 instructions, allowing multiple back-back interrupts to be
handled without saving and restoring contexts.  On a simple pipeline
with a one-cycle load-use penalty, single-cycle CSR access, and a
one-cycle taken-branch penalty, the service loop can initiate a new
interrupt service with only 7 clock cycles of overhead per handler
call.

<14> This instruction sequence restores the OIC.  Interrupts are still
enabled, so preemption is allowed during this restore.

<15> Interrupts are disabled for the final steps of restoring the OIC,
which requires loading `mcause` and `mepc` from the stacked values,
and recovering the final register values from the OIC.

<16> A final read of {nxti} is performed before returning, to reduce
the maximum interrupt latency.  If a suitable interrupt arrives, it
can be serviced without saving context.  The `csrrci` instruction
includes a redundant clear of the interrupt enable bit to ensure the
CSR state updates occur.  Interrupts must stay disabled until after
the following branch to maintain the critical section used to restore
the OIC in the case that there is no interrupt to service.

The following table summarizes the machine state changes that occur at
the first {nxti}:

=== Revised C-ABI for Embedded RISC-V

The overhead to save and restore registers in the interrupt trampoline
can be reduced with a new embedded ABI that reduces the number of
caller-save registers.  Work is underway to define such an ABI, but it
is likely to require around 7 integer registers to be saved/restored
instead of 16 in the standard Unix ABI.

This will result in 18 instructions executed in the trampoline code
before arriving at the correct handler function, of which 9 are stores
(saving 7 registers plus 2 words for {epc} and {cause}).

=== Analysis of worst-case interrupt latencies for C-ABI trampoline

The following analysis assumes a system with M-mode only and a new
embedded ABI requiring 7 caller-save registers to be saved and
restored.  For cycle timings, we assume a simple 3-stage pipeline that
has a one-cycle taken-branch or pipeline flush penalty, a one-cycle
load-use delay, and single-cycle CSR access.  This simple model
ignores effects from contention in shared memory structures, or
pipeline hazards from continuing long-latency operations in the
interrupted code.

There are several cases to consider for the worst-case latency for a
C-ABI higher-level interrupt handler that preempts lower-level code.

If an interrupt arrives while interrupts are enabled, either inside or
outside of a current handler, the processor will jump directly to
`irq_enter` at the new interrupt level.  The system must flush the
execution pipeline and then execute 18 instructions, the last of which
is the `jalr` that calls the handler function.  These 18 instructions
execute in 20 cycles using the simple pipeline model.

When interrupts are disabled, the arriving preempting handler could be
delayed.  If the preempting interrupt arrives while interrupts are
disabled during the initial entry sequence (1)--(6), there will be no
additional delay as the first {nxti} instruction (6) will cause the
higher-level interrupt handler to be invoked, replacing the original
interrupt cause.

If the preempting interrupt arrives after interrupts are disabled (15)
but before {nxti} is read (16), then the trampoline will observe the
new interrupt during execution of the {nxti} read (16), and take a
short branch back to the `service_loop`, which is lower latency than
the interrupt-disabled case.

If the preempting interrupt arrives after the read of {nxti} commits
(16), then the interrupt has to wait an additional 4 instructions
until the `mret` reenables interrupts, at which point the interrupt
will be taken and the handler entered at `irq_enter`.  In the simple
pipeline model, `mret` adds an additional pipeline flush cycle, so the
preemption latency is 20+5 cycles, which represents the worst-case for
a preempting C-ABI interrupt handler.

== Interrupt-Driven C-ABI Model

For many embedded systems, after initialization, essentially all code
is run in response to an interrupt, interrupt levels are used to
prioritize execution of different tasks, and the processor should
sleep inbetween interrupt events to save energy.

The following code can be used as the background code that runs at
interrupt level 0 and which when there is no active work to do, puts
the processor to sleep with no active context, waiting for an
interrupt using the `wfi` instruction.  The code is entered at the
`enter_loop` location and never returns directly.

[source]
----
    # Source code for interrupt-driven model background code.
sleep:
    csrrci x0, mstatus, MIE # Disable interrupts.  <1>
    wfi                     # Processor waits for next interrupt event.
    csrrsi a0, mnxti, MIE   # Gather interrupt details, and enable interrupts. <2>
    beqz a0, sleep          # Go back to sleep if no interrupt (will be preempted if SHV). <3>

service_loop: <4>
    lw a1, (a0)             # Get handler address.
    csrrsi x0, mstatus, MIE # Enable interrupts    
    jalr a1                 # Call C-ABI handler routine
    csrrsi a0, mnxti, MIE   # Claim any pending interrupt at level > 0
    bnez a0, service_loop   # Loop to service any interrupt.

    # This is also entry point to begin sleeping.
enter_sleep: <5>
    la a0, sleep
    csrci x0, mstatus, MIE  # Disable interrupts.
    #--- Interrupts disabled
    csrw mepc, a0           # Initialize mepc to point to sleep
    li a0, (MMODE)<<PP|(0)<<PIL|(1)<<PIE
    csrw mcause, a0         # Initialize mcause to have pp=M, pil=0, pie=1
    mret                    # Jump to sleep at level 0 with interrupts enabled.
    #--- Interrupts enabled
----

<1> The `sleep` loop is used to stall the processor while waiting for
work and is always entered at interrupt level 0.  Interrupts are
disabled, then a `wfi` is executed.  The `wfi` will stall the
processor until some event occurs.  When an event, including an
interrupt occurs, the `wfi` retires.  Because interrupts are disabled,
the hart does not jump to an interrupt handler but instead executes
the next instruction, avoiding context save/restore overhead.

<2> The read of {nxti} will determine if any non-SHV interrupt is
available, and if so return a pointer to the table entry.  Interrupts
are enabled by this instruction to allow SHV interrupts to be taken
via preemption.

<3> The value in `a0` checked by the branch can be zero for two
reasons. Either there was no interrupt detected or an SHV interrupt
was detected.  If there was no interrupt, the branch loops back to put
the hart to sleep.  Interrupts are enabled, so any SHV interrupt
(which all have higher interrupt level than the current interrupt
level of 0) will preempt the branch's execution and call the SHV
handler.  Once the SHV handler returns, the branch will resume and
cause execution to return back to the `sleep_loop`.

<4> The service loop is identical to that in the C-ABI interrupt
handler, except that the previous interrupt level is 0, so all pending
interrupts will be serviced in the loop before the loop exits.
Interrupts are enabled, so preemption is allowed for both C-ABI
trampoline and SHV interrupts.  When an SHV interrupt at the same or
lower interrupt level is the next to be serviced, the {nxti}
instruction will return 0 causing execution to drop out of the loop.
The following code will reinitialize the hart's interrupt level to 0,
and disable interrupts for one instruction, to ensure the SHV
interrupt will be taken.

<5> This code initializes `mepc` and `mcause` then uses an `mret` to
jump to the `sleep` loop while simultaneously reseting interrupt level
to 0 and enabling interrupts.  This is also the entry point to
initiate interrupt-driven execution.  Interrupts are enabled to allow
SHV interrupts to preempt execution on the first instruction in
`sleep` (which disables interrupts again).

This code does not increase worst-case interrupt latency over that of
the C-ABI trampoline.

== Alternate Interrupt Models for Software Vectoring

Platforms may only implement non-vectored CLIC mode
(`mtvec`=`?000010`) without selective hardware vectoring
(`clic.nvbits=0`), in which case, hardware vectoring can be emulated
by a single software trampoline present at `NBASE` using the separate
vector table address in {tvt}.  There are several different software
approaches possible, depending on system requirements and constraints,
as detailed in following subsections.

===  `gp` trampoline to inline interrupt handlers in single privilege mode

Where interrupts are known to be generated and handled in a single
privilege mode (i.e., M-mode only systems, or U-mode interrupt
handlers), a three-instruction sequence using the `gp` register to
hold the handler address can be used to indirect to an inline
interrupt handler of the type described in <<Inlines>>.

[source]
----
    # Software-vectored interrupt servicing.
    # Only safe for horizontal interrupts.
    # Must be placed three instructions back from gp.
irq_enter:
    csrrci gp, mnxti, MIE   # Overwrite gp, keep interrupts disabled.
    beqz gp, handle_exc     # Encountered exception.
    jalr gp, gp             # Recreate gp and jump to handler.
gp:                         # Must be right before system's gp location.
    # ... gp data section

    # Must be within range of beqz instruction.
handle_exc:
    # Has to recreate gp.
----

The three-instruction sequence relies on the `jalr` instruction
recreating the value in the `gp` register, which is a known constant
pointing into the middle of the global data area, by placing the
`jalr` directly before the `gp` location in memory.  The routine
jumped to by the `jalr` does not return via a `j ra` but instead ends
with an `mret`.

NOTE: This constraint on memory layout might not always be possible,
particularly if the system does not allow placing executable memory
right next to read-write memory, for example if the system does not
allow a protection boundary to be placed at 'gp' and if executable
code must not be writeable.

The code can be used with preemptible inline interrupt handlers.

=== Trampoline for preemptible inline handlers 

This section describes a more general software-trampoline scheme for
calling preemptible inline handlers, which factors out the
{epc}/{cause} save code into the trampoline, and which uses a
different interrupt handler calling convention.

The interrupt handlers for this scheme have a calling convention where
there is one caller-save argument register `a0` that passes in the
handler address to distinguish different interrupt inputs, and one
temporary register `a1` that is also caller-save.  These two registers
had to be saved already by the trampoline. All other registers are
callee-save, except for the return address `ra`.  The handler normally
returns with a regular `j ra`.

[source]

  addi sp, sp, FRAMESIZE  # Deallocate stack space
  mret                    # Return from handler.
  #------------------------------------#
----

This interrupt handler can be used together with the `wfi` sleep
background routine shown above.

== Managing Interrupt Stacks Across Privilege Modes

Interrupt handlers need to have a place to save the previous context's
state to provide working registers for the handler code.  If a handler
can be entered from a lower-privilege mode, a pointer to some safe
memory for the context save must be swapped in at entry to the
higher-privileged handler to avoid security holes. The RISC-V
privileged architecture provides the {scratch} register to hold this
information for a higher-privilege mode while executing in a
lower-privilege mode.  For the following discussion and code examples,
the assumption is that {scratch} is used to hold the
higher-privilege-mode stack pointer but other software conventions are
possible (e.g., {scratch} points to a thread context block).

Existing RISC-V ABIs allow addresses immediately below the stack
pointer to be overwritten by interrupt service routines.  The current
stack pointer in `sp` (`x2`) should be swapped with {scratch} whenever
a handler is entered from a lower-privilege mode, but should not be
swapped if entered from another handler in the same privilege mode,
including when preempting an existing interrupt handler.  At exit from
a handler, the lower-privilege stack pointer should be swapped back in
if transitioning back to the lower-privilege mode.

=== Software Privileged Stack Swap

In this convention, when code is running in a lower privilege mode,
{scratch} holds the stack pointer for the higher-privilege mode.  When
the higher-privilege mode is entered, {scratch} is set to zero to
signal to any preempting handlers that the stack pointer has already
been swapped.

The old stack pointer is saved to new stack frame before new frame is
created by bumping stack pointer, but this is done with interrupts
disabled.

    mret                    # Return from interrupt.
  #-----------------------------------------------------------------------
----

This code can be used in a secure model where user-level code has one
stack, and all interrupts and exceptions are handled on a second
M-mode-only stack.  In addition, background non-handler code in M-mode
can either use the same M-mode stack as the interrupt handler, or a
separate M-mode stack.  The only difference is in the value held in
{scratch} while the M-mode background thread is running (either 0 to
indicate use the existing stack pointer in `sp` or non-zero to
indicate this stack pointer should be used in the handler.

=== Optional Scratch Swap CSR ({scratchcsw}) for multiple privilege modes

The above software scheme adds 7 instructions to the interrupt code
path when preempting the same privilege mode, and adds an additional 6
instructions (13 total including two taken branches) for interrupts
from a lower-privilege mode into a higher-privileged mode.

To accelerate interrupt handling with multiple privilege modes, a new
CSR {scratchcsw} can be defined for all but the lowest privilege mode
to support conditional swapping of the {scratch} register when
transitioning between privilege modes.  The CSR instruction is used
once at the entry to a handler routine and once at handler exit, so
only adds two instructions to the interrupt code path.  Though
designed to be used with `csrrw` instructions, these CSRs can be
accessed with any CSR instruction.

For all CSR instructions accessing {scratchcsw}, the value written into
`rd` is either {scratch} if {pp} is different than the current
privilege mode, or `rs1` if {pp} is the same as the current privilege
mode.  The {scratch} register is only written if there is a privilege
mode difference, and if so, it is written obeying the usual CSR
read-modify-write conventions (e.g., swap/set/clear bits) using the
original {scratch} value as one source operand and the other source
operand specified as usual in the instruction.

NOTE: This is different than a regular CSR instruction as the value
returned is different from the value used in the read-modify-write
operation.

NOTE: The CSR instructions are defined to always copy a result
({scratch} or `rs1`) to the `rd` destination to simplify
implementations using register renaming, and in normal use the
instructions set both `rs1` = `sp` and `rd` = `sp`.

[source]
----
  csrrw rd, mscratchcsw, rs1

  // Pseudocode operation.
  if (mcause.mpp!=M-mode) then {
      t = rs1; rd = mscratch; mscratch = t;
  } else {
      rd = rs1; // mscratch unchanged.
  }

  // Usual use: csrrw sp, mscratchcsw, sp
----

NOTE: To avoid virtualization holes, software cannot directly read the
hart's current privilege mode.  The swap instruction will trap if
software tries to access a given mode's {scratchcsw} CSR from a
lesser-privileged mode, so the new CSR does not open a virtualization
hole.

==== Stack Swap Example Code

Interrupt handlers running in the lowest privilege mode do not need to
swap stack pointers, as they will only be entered by a horizontal
interrupt from the same privilege mode.  In systems with multiple
privilege modes, handlers running in higher privilege modes must
account for vertical interrupts taken from a lower privilege mode (in
which case the stack pointer must be swapped) as well as horizontal
interrupts from the same privilege mode.

----

In all cases, conditionally swapping the stack to account for
potential privilege-mode changes adds two extra instructions to all
interrupt handlers.

== Separating stack per interrupt level

Within a single privilege mode, it can be useful to separate interrupt
handler tasks from application tasks to increase robustness, reduce
space usage, and aid in system debugging.  Interrupt handler tasks
have non-zero interrupt levels, while application tasks have an
interrupt level of zero.

=== Optional Scratch Swap CSR ({scratchcswl}) for interrupt levels

A new {scratchcswl} CSR is added to support faster swapping of the
stack pointer between interrupt and non-interrupt code running in the
same privilege mode.

[source]
----
  csrrw rd, mscratchcswl, rs1

  // Pseudocode operation.
  if ( (mcause.pil==0) != (mintstatus.mil==0) ) then {
      t = rs1; rd = mscratch; mscratch = t;
  } else {
      rd = rs1; // mscratch unchanged.
  }

  // Usual use: csrrw sp, mscratchcswl, sp
----

This new CSR operates similarly to {scratchcsw} except that the swap
condition is true when the interrupter and interruptee are not both
application tasks or not both interrupt handlers.

== Safe execution of urgent interrupts in lower-privileged modes

NOTE: This is a preliminary proposal.

In some case it is desirable to preempt a higher-privilege mode to
execute time-critical interrupts in a lower-privilege mode.  These
cases are handled by registering an interrupt handler trampoline in
the higher-privilege mode at the appropriate interrupt level which
then sets up a call to the user-level interrupt code.

The higher-privilege trampoline code has to perform the following
operations:

- save entire higher-privilege context state
- clear entire context state
- ensure "trap on lower-privilege RET instruction"  is set
- set timeout timer
- redirect to lower-privilege handler
- lower-privilege handler runs, and either exits with a RET that
  causes a trap, or timeout timer interrupt
- restore entire higher-privilege context state

The {status} register already contains a `TSR` bit to trap on
supervisor return.  An additional `TUR` bit in {status} would allowing
trapping user-level URET instructions to support such interrupts.

A complication is that the user-level interrupt handler might be
preempted by another user-level handler at a higher interrupt level,
which will execute URET but for a different context than that intiated
by the higher-privilege mode.  This problem can be avoided by always
running the urgent lower-privilege handlers at the highest interrupt
level in the the lower-privilege mode.

== CLIC Interrupt IDs

The original CLINT interrupts retain their interrupt ID in CLIC mode.
The `clicintctl` settings are now used to delegate these interrupts as
required.

An additional CLIC software interrupt bit (csip) is provided.  This is
generally available for software use, but is usually used for the
local background interrupt thread.

CLIC interrupt inputs are allocated IDs beginning at interrupt ID 16.
Any fast local interrupts that would have been connected at interrupt
ID 16 and above should now be mapped into corresponding inputs of the
CLIC.

== CLIC memory map

=== CLIC/CLINT shared memory map

The CLIC reuses the CLINT memory map for the `msip`, `mtimecmp`, and
`mtime` memory-mapped registers.  This simplifies providing both CLINT
and CLIC mode in the same hardware.  The CLIC/CLINT memory map is
given relative to a local interrupt base address (in SiFive Freedom
platforms, the local interrupt base address is `0x0200_0000`).

=== M-Mode CLIC regions

Each hart has a separate CLIC accessed by a separate address region.
The following is the memory map of the 4KiB memory region designed to
support M-mode access.  Where a system has PMP, this region must be
made accessible to the M-mode software running on the hart.

[source]
----

0xc00     1B          RW            cliccfg

clicintip[i] is read-only for level-based interrupts and read-write
for edge-triggered interrupts.
----

NOTE: The `clicintip[__i__]` region is placed first as this is the
only region usually written in interrupt handlers to clear down
edge-triggered interrupt signal bits.  The CLIC base address, which
also corresponds to the start of the `clicintip` array, can be loaded
with a single `lui` instruction to reduce instruction count in
handlers that have to calculate the appropriate `clicintip[__i__]`
address.

If an input _i_ is not present in the hardware, the corresponding
`clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, `clicintctl[__i__]` memory
locations appear hardwired to zero.

In systems that support additional privilege modes on a hart, an
additional memory region is defined for each privilege mode that
provides a restricted view of the CLIC's state.

=== S-Mode CLIC regions for M/S/U harts

Supervisor-mode CLIC regions only expose interrupts that have been
configured to be supervisor-accessible via the M-mode CLIC region.
System software must configure virtual memory and PMP permissions to
only allow access to this region from appropriate supervisor-mode
code.


[source]
----
Layout of Supervisor-mode CLIC regions
0x000+i   1B/input    R or RW       clicintip[i]

0x800+i   1B/input    RW            clicintctl[i]
----

Any interrupt _i_ that is not accessible to S-mode appears as
hard-wired zeros in `clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, and
`clicintctl[__i__]`.

Where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 0, all interrupts are M-mode only, and all
are inaccessible to S-mode.

Where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 1, if `clicintctl[__i__]` is set to S-mode
(bit 7 is clear), interrupt _i_ is visible in the S-mode region except
that only the low 7 bits of `clicintctl[__i__]` can be written via the
S-mode memory region.

Where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 2, if bit 7 of `clicintctl[__i__]` is clear
(S-mode or U-mode), interrupt _i_ is visible through the S-mode region
except that only the low 7 bits of `clicintctl[__i__]` can be written
via the S-mode memory region.  This allows the supervisor region to be
used to selectively configure the interrupt as S-mode or U-mode.

=== U-Mode CLIC regions in M/U harts or M/S/U harts

User-mode CLIC regions only expose interrupts that have been
configured to be user-accessible via the M-mode CLIC region.  System
software must configure virtual memory and PMP permissions to only
allow access to this region from appropriate user-mode code.

[source]

0x800+i   1B/input    RW            clicintctl[i]
----

Any interrupt _i_ that is not accessible to U-mode appears as
hard-wired zeros in `clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, and
`clicintctl[__i__]`.

Where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 0, all interrupts are M-mode only, and all
are inaccessible to U-mode.

In M/U-only harts, where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 1, if `clicintctl[__i__]`
is set to U-mode (bit 7 is clear), then interrupt _i_ is visible in the
U-mode region except that only the low 7 bits of `clicintctl[__i__]`
can be written via the U-mode memory region.

In M/S/U harts, if `cliccfg.nmbits`{lt} 2 then all interrupts are
either M-mode or S-mode, and all are inaccessible to U-mode.

In M/S/U harts, where `cliccfg.nmbits` = 2, if `clicintctl[__i__]` is
set to U-mode (bits 6 and 7 are clear), then interrupt _i_ is visible
in the U-mode region except that only the low 6 bits of
`clicintctl[__i__]` can be written via the U-mode memory region.

=== CLIC memory map for Multiple Harts

In a system with multiple harts, the M-mode CLIC regions for all the
harts are placed contiguously in the memory space, followed by the
S-mode CLIC regions for all harts.

In the SiFive Freedom platforms, the memory map is as follows,
supporting up to 512 CLICs in a platform:

----
  0x0200_0000   CLINT

  0x0280_0000   M-mode aperture for CLIC 0
  0x0280_1000   M-mode aperture for CLIC 1
  ...
  0x02A0_0000   HS-mode aperture for CLIC 0
  0x02A0_1000   HS-mode aperture for CLIC 1
  ...
  0x02C0_0000   S-mode aperture for CLIC 0
  0x02C0_1000   S-mode aperture for CLIC 1
  ...
  0x02E0_0000   U-mode aperture for CLIC 0
  0x02E0_1000   U-mode aperture for CLIC 1
----

=== Expanded CLIC Memory Map Option

NOTE: This is an early proposal.

The expanded CLIC memory map provides a simpler interface to the
individual fields in `clicintctl` and now supports up to 4,096 total
interrupt inputs.  A systems supporting the expanded CLIC memory map
must also support the original compressed CLIC memory map.  The two
CLIC memory regions will control the same hardware.

  ...
  0x7FFF     1B/input    RW        clicintctl[4095].shv

clicintip[i] is read-only for level-based interrupts and read-write
for edge-triggered interrupts.
----

The expanded memory map retains the same byte address for interrupt
pending and interrupt enable, but expands the interrupt control
register into four separate byte fields.  Each of the mode, level,
priority, and selective-hardware vectoring settings is allocated a
separate byte address.  The bits that are writeable/readable in that
byte are those selected by `cliccfg`.  A single 32-bit memory
instruction can access all four bytes controlling a single interrupt's
settings.

Any writable mode bits are made accessible in the least-significant
bits of the first byte, with the upper bits hardwired to zero.  If
there are no mode bits, then the whole byte is hardwired to return
zero.

Any writable level bits are made accessible in the most-significant
bits of the level byte, while the least-significant bits return 1 when
read.

Any writable priority bits are made accessible in the most-significant
bits of the priority byte, while the least-significant bits return 1
when read.

If the selective hardware vectoring bit is supported it appears in the
LSB of the shv byte.  The upper bits return 0 when read.

Writing to the SHV byte when selective hardware vectoring is enabled
can change the mode, level, or priority bytes also depending on the
value in `cliccfg`, which determines which of these fields overlaps
with SHV.

----

Other privilege modes have a similar memory layout in a different
memory region to support multiple privilege modes.  In each
lower-privilege aperture, only those interrupt inputs that have been
configured by machine mode will appear in the lower-privilege memory
aperture.

== CLIC and Message-Signalled Interrupts (MSI)

NOTE: This is an early proposal.

PCI MSIs contain an interrupt number in the data portion of a memory
store.  The CLIC will be extended to add another address to which MSIs
can be directed.  A MSI store to that address will set the
`clicintip[__i__]` bit corresponding to the MSI data value.  The CLIC
MSI address will reside in the same `0xc00` region as the `cliccfg`
field, and will also be made available in S-mode and U-mode regions to
allow MSIs to be restricted to S-mode and U-mode interrupt inputs
respectively.

The same mechanism can also be used by other software and non-PCI
devices.
