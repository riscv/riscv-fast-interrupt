== Increase of AIA local interrupts - smclicincr

The smclicincr extension increases support up to 4096 interrupt inputs per hart.
Each interrupt input _i_ has five control
registers: an interrupt-pending bit (`clicintip[__i__]`),
an interrupt-enable bit (`clicintie[__i__]`), interrupt attributes
(`clicintattr[__i__]`) to specify trigger type, 
(`cliciprio[__i__]`) to specify priority, and 
(`clicmideleg[__i__]`) to delegate interrupts to a lower privilege level.

NOTE: The existing timer (`mtip`/`stip`), software
(`msip`/`ssip`), and external interrupt inputs
(`meip`/`seip`) can be treated as additional local interrupt
sources, where the privilege mode, interrupt level, and priority can
be altered using `clicintattr[__i__]` and
`cliciprio[__i__]` and `clicmideleg[__i__]` registers.

With this extension, for implementations that do not require CLINT compatibility, the allocation of interrupt ordering (e.g. meip, mtip, msip) 
are allowed to be defined by the platform. A platform definition will often be based on a specific RISC-V ISA profile, 
where RISC-V ISA profiles specify a common set of ISA choices that capture the most value for most users to enable software compatibility.

=== CLIC Interrupt Attribute (`cliciprio`)
Each interrupt has an associated priority as defined in the AIA specification.
For the first 64 interrupts, these registers mirror the values of iprio registers in the AIA specification.

=== CLIC Interrupt Attribute (`clicmideleg`)
Each interrupt has an associated interrupt privilege mode delegation as defined in the AIA specification.
For the first 64 interrupts, these registers mirror the values of mideleg bits in the AIA specification.

=== CLIC Interrupt Attribute (`clicintattr`)

This is an 8-bit WARL read-write register to specify various attributes for each interrupt.

NOTE: This register is defined as WARL as some implementations may want to hardwire to fixed values
only trigger/shv types.

.clicintattr[i] register layout
include::images/wavedrom/clicintattri.edn[]

The 2-bit `trig` WARL field specifies the trigger type and polarity for each
interrupt input. Bit 1, `trig[0]`, is defined as "edge-triggered"
(0: level-triggered, 1: edge-triggered); while bit 2, `trig[1]`, is defined
as "negative-edge" (0: positive-edge, 1: negative-edge).
More specifically, there can be four possible combinations:
positive level-triggered, negative level-triggered, positive edge-triggered,
and negative edge-triggered.

The shv field is reserved and contains the shv bit when the smclicshv extension is present. 

=== CLIC Interrupt Pending (`clicintip`)
Each interrupt has an associated interrupt pending.
For the first 64 interrupts, these registers mirror the values of mip CSR.

When the input is configured for level-sensitive input, the
`clicintip[__i__]` bit reflects the value of an input signal to the
interrupt controller after any conditional inversion specified by the
`clicintattr[__i__]` field, and software writes to the bit are ignored.
Software clears the interrupt at the source device.

When the input is configured for edge-sensitive input,
`clicintip[__i__]` is a read-write register that can be updated both
by hardware interrupt inputs and by software.  The bit is set by
hardware after an edge of the appropriate polarity is observed on the
interrupt input, as determined by the `clicintattr[__i__]` field.
Software writes to `clicintip[__i__]` can set or
clear edge-triggered pending bits directly by writes to the
`clicintip[__i__]` register. 
`clicintip[__i__]` behavior is unaffected by `clicintie[__i__]` setting.


The value in the `clicintip[__i__]` is undefined when switching from
level-sensitive mode to edge-triggered mode in `clicintattr[__i__]`.

NOTE: Software cannot rely on the underlying `clicintip[__i__]`
register bits used in edge-triggered mode to hold state while in
level-sensitive mode.

=== CLIC Interrupt Enable (`clicintie`)
Each interrupt has an associated interrupt enable.
For the first 64 interrupts, these bits mirror the values of mie CSR.

Each interrupt input has a dedicated interrupt-enable WARL bit (`clicintie[__i__]`)
This control bit is read-write to enable/disable the corresponding interrupt.
Software should assume `clicintie[__i__]`=0 means no interrupt enabled, and `clicintie[__i__]`=1 indicates an interrupt is enabled.

NOTE: `clicintie[__i__]` is the individual enable bit while {status}.{ie} is
the global enable bit for the current privilege mode. Therefore, for an
interrupt `_i_` to be enabled in the current privilege mode, both `clicintie[__i__]`
and {status}.{ie} have to be set.


NOTE: In contrast, since {status}.{ie} only takes effect in the current privilege
mode according to RISC-V convention, an interrupt `_i_` from a higher privilege mode
is enabled as long as `clicintie[__i__]` is set (regardless of the setting
of {status}.{ie} in the higher privilege modes).

NOTE: This register bit is defined as WARL as unimplemented interrupts appear hardwired to zero.

==== Major interrupt numbers

CLIC provides up to 4096 major interrupt numbers indicated
with {mcause} Exception Code (`exccode`) values. 

=== Indirect Access M-mode CLIC interrupt CSRs

Access to CLIC registers `clicintattr[__i__]`, `clicintip[__i__]`, `clicintie[__i__]`, `cliciprio[__i__]`, and `clicideleg[__i__]`
utilizes the Indirect CSR Access extension (Smcsrind/Sscsrind). Implementations may support
another method to access these CSRs (e.g., via memory-mapped accesses) and any such a definition is outside the scope
of the CLIC specification.

If an interrupt _i_ is not present in the hardware, the corresponding CLIC register
locations appear hardwired to zero.

All CLIC registers are visible to M-mode.

NOTE: Since accessing clic registers via indirect CSR access is not atomic, 
indirect CSR access of these registers while same privilege mode {mstatus}.`mie` is enabled 
requires `mireg` register state to be part of the interrupt handler's overall context state save/restore, 
although this is expected to be an atypical need for most interrupt handlers.

==== `clicintattr[__i__]`

In this `miselect` offset range:

* When XLEN = 32, each `mireg2` register controls the clic attribute setting of four interrupts, with one 8-bit byte per interrupt.

== Same Privilege Mode Interrupt Preemption Support - smclic

This extension requires smclicincr extension.

The smclic extension extends interrupt preemption to support up to 256 interrupt
levels for each privilege mode, where higher-numbered interrupt levels
can preempt lower-numbered interrupt levels.  Interrupt level 0
corresponds to regular execution outside of an interrupt handler.
Levels 1--255 correspond to interrupt handler levels. 

Incoming interrupts with a higher interrupt level can preempt an
active interrupt handler running at a lower interrupt level in the
same privilege mode, provided interrupts are globally enabled in this
privilege mode.

NOTE: Existing RISC-V interrupt behavior is retained, where incoming
interrupts for a higher privilege mode can preempt an active interrupt
handler running in a lower privilege mode, regardless of global
interrupt enable in lower privilege mode.

=== CLIC Interrupt Input Control (`clicintlvl`)

`clicintlvl[__i__]` is an 8-bit WARL control register
to specify interrupt levels 1-255. 
0 is only valid when the interrupt is not implemented or visible.

To select an interrupt to present to the core, the CLIC hardware
combines the interrupt privilege mode encoding and
`clicintlvl` to form an unsigned integer, then picks the global maximum
across all pending-and-enabled interrupts based on this value.
Next priority is determined using the AIA iprio rules. 
Finally, the interrupt level of this selected interrupt is
compared with the interrupt-level threshold of the associated privilege
mode to determine whether it is qualified or masked by the threshold
(and thus no interrupt is presented).

NOTE: Implementations can choose to hardcode all iprio to the same non-zero value to simplify priority calculation.

NOTE: Selecting an interrupt at a high privilege mode masks any
interrupt at a lower privilege mode since the higher-privilege mode
causes the interrupt signal to appear more urgent than any lower-privilege
mode interrupt.

NOTE: This register is defined as WARL as some implementations may want to support a limited number
of values in this register including hardwiring some bits to fixed values.

NOTE: Within a single privilege mode, it can be useful to separate interrupt
handler tasks from application tasks to increase robustness, reduce
space usage, and aid in system debugging.  Interrupt handler tasks
have non-zero interrupt levels, while application tasks have an
interrupt level of zero.

=== New {mtvec} CSR Mode for CLIC

The CLIC interrupt-handling mode is encoded as a new state in the
existing {mtvec} WARL register, where {mtvec}.`mode` (the two
least-significant bits) is `11`.

.CLIC mode xtvec register layout

NOTE: CLINT mode in this specification is defined as `mtvec.mode=00` or `mtvec.mode=01`.

----

In CLIC mode, synchronous exception traps always jump to NBASE.

If the hart is currently running at some privilege mode (`pp`) at some
interrupt level (`pil`) and an enabled interrupt becomes pending at
any interrupt level in a higher privilege mode or if an interrupt assigned to a
higher interrupt level in the current privilege mode becomes pending
and interrupts are globally enabled in this privilege mode, then
execution is immediately transferred to a handler running with the new
interrupt's privilege mode (`**__x__**`) and interrupt level (`il`).

==== New Interrupt Status ({mpintstatus}) CSR

A new M-mode CSR, `mpintstatus`, holds consolidated state of preempted context.

NOTE: Previous versions of CLIC modified the {cause} CSR to contain preempted context.
{pintstatus} has been added to allow implementations to maintain {cause} compatibility between
CLIC and CLINT modes.

As stated in the RISC-V privilege specification,
when a trap is taken from privilege mode y into privilege mode x,
xPIE is set to the value of xIE; xIE is set to 0; and
xPP is set to y.  xepc is written with the virtual address of the instruction
that was interrupted or that encountered the exception.
Additionally in CLIC mode, interrupt level (`xpil`) is set to xintstatus.xil and
xcause.exccode is written with a code indicating the event (the id of the
interrupt or exception code) that caused the trap.

Note: Switching to CLINT mode
from CLIC mode causes {pil} in that privilege mode to be zeroed.


==== New Interrupt Status ({mintstatus}) CSR

A new M-mode CSR, `mintstatus`, holds the active interrupt level for
each supported privilege mode.  These fields are read-only.  The
primary reason to expose these fields is to support debug.

==== New Interrupt-Level Threshold ({mintthresh}) CSRs

The interrupt-level threshold ({mintthresh}) is a new read-write WARL CSR,
which holds an 8-bit field (`th`) for the threshold level of the
machine privilege mode.  The `th` field is held in the least-significant
8 bits of the CSR, and zero should be written to the upper bits.

A typical usage of the interrupt-level threshold is for implementing
critical sections. The current handler can temporarily raise its effective
interrupt level to implement a critical section among a subset of levels,
while still allowing higher interrupt levels to preempt.

The current hart's effective interrupt level would then be:
    effective_level = max({mintstatus}.`mil``, {mintthresh}.`th`)

The max is used to prevent a hart from dropping below its original level
which would break assumptions in design, and also makes it
simple for software to remove threshold without knowing its own level
by simply setting {mintthresh} to the lowest supported {mintthresh} value.

The interrupt-level threshold is only valid when running in associated
privilege mode and not in other modes. This is because interrupts for
lower privilege modes are always disabled, whereas interrupts for higher
privilege modes are always enabled.

If the hart is currently running at some privilege mode `*x*`, an {ret}
instruction that changes the privilege mode to a mode less
privileged than `x` also sets {intthresh} to the lowest supported {intthresh} value.
This helps software avoid a higher privilege mode from having a non-minimum threshold while a lower
privilege mode is running.

NOTE: The anticipated use of threshold is to provide critical sections
within code running at one privilege mode, not to selectively mask
interrupts before running lower-privilege code.  If desired,
higher-privilege-mode interrupts can be selectively disabled using
local interrupt enables before switching to a lower privilege mode.

NOTE: This behavior significantly reduces the hardware cost because it
only needs to select one global maximum interrupt and compare with the
threshold of the associated privilege mode.  If higher-privilege modes
could have non-minimum thresholds, hardware would have to select multiple
maximum interrupts (one for the current mode and one for each
higher-privilege mode) qualified by the per-mode threshold, then pick
a qualified maximum interrupt with the highest privilege mode.

=== smclic Reset Behavior

In general in RISC-V, mandatory reset state is minimized but platform
specifications or company policy might add additional reset
requirements.  Since the general privileged architecture states that
mstatus.mie is reset to zero, interrupts will not be enabled coming
out of reset.

==== smclic mandatory reset state

{mintstatus}.`mil` and {mpintstatus}.`mpil` fields reset to 0.  Interrupt level 0 corresponds to regular
execution outside of an interrupt handler.

The reset behavior of other fields is platform-specific.

=== smclic Interrupt Operation

This section describes the operation of smclic interrupts.

==== General Interrupt Overview

At any time, a hart is running in some privilege mode with some
interrupt level.  The hart's privilege mode is held internally but is not visible to software running on a hart (to avoid
virtualization holes), but the current interrupt level is made visible
in the {intstatus} register.

Within a privilege mode `*_x_*`, if the associated global
interrupt-enable {ie} is clear, then no interrupts will be taken in
that privilege mode, but a pending-enabled interrupt in a higher
privilege mode will preempt current execution.  If {ie} is set, then
pending-enabled interrupts at a higher interrupt level in the same
privilege mode will preempt current execution and run the interrupt
handler for the higher interrupt level.

As with the existing RISC-V mechanism, when an interrupt or
synchronous exception is taken, the privilege mode and interrupt level
are modified to reflect the new privilege mode and interrupt level.
The global interrupt-enable bit of the handler's privilege mode is
cleared, to prevent preemption by higher-level interrupts in the same
privilege mode.

The overall behavior is summarized in the following table: the Current
`p/ie/il` fields represent the current privilege mode `P` (not
software visible), interrupt enable `ie` =
({status}.{ie} & `clicintie[__i__]`)  and interrupt
level `L` = max({intstatus}.{il}, {intthresh}.`th`);
the CLIC `priv`,`level`, and `id` fields
represent the highest-ranked interrupt currently present in the CLIC
with `nP` representing the new privilege mode, `nL` representing the
new interrupt level, and `id` representing the interrupt's id;
Current' shows the `p/ie/il` context in the handler's privilege mode;
`pc` represents the program counter with `V` representing the result
of any hardware vectoring; `cde` represents the {cause} `exccode`
field; while the Previous `pp/il/ie/epc` columns represent previous
context fields in {mpintstatus} and {epc}.

==== smclic events that cause the hart to resume execution after Wait for Interrupt (WFI) Instruction
As described in the privileged specification, the Wait for Interrupt instruction (WFI) provides a hint to the implementation that the current hart can be stalled.  The hart may optionally resume execution anytime.  This section describes CLIC events that must cause the hart to resume execution.

NOTE: WFI can be a NOP and not actually pause hart execution. In addition,
implementations can resume execution after a WFI for any other reason.

As in the privileged specification, if an interrupt is taken while the hart is stalled, the interrupt
trap will be taken on the following instruction, i.e., execution resumes in the trap handler and mepc
= pc + 4.  If the event that causes the hart to resume execution does not cause an interrupt to be taken,
execution will resume at pc + 4.

In smclic mode, similar to CLINT mode, events causing the hart to resume execution after a Wait for Interrupt instruction (WFI) are
unaffected by the global interrupt-enable bits in {status}.{ie} but should
honor `clicintie[__i__]` and {intthresh}.

.A pending-and-enabled interrupt _i_ causes the hart to resume execution if interrupt _i_
* has a higher privilege mode than the current privilege mode and
* the interrupt priority reduction tree selects interrupt _i_ as the maximum across all pending-and-enabled interrupts and

.A pending-and-enabled interrupt _i_ causes the hart to resume execution if interrupt _i_
* has the same privilege mode as the current privilege mode and
* the interrupt priority reduction tree selects interrupt _i_ as the maximum across all pending-and-enabled interrupts and
* the interrupt _i_ level is greater than max({intstatus}.{il}, {intthresh}.`th` )

.A pending-and-enabled interrupt _i_ causes the hart to resume execution if interrupt _i_
* has a lower privilege mode than the current privilege mode and
* the interrupt priority reduction tree selects interrupt _i_ as the maximum across all pending-and-enabled interrupts and

NOTE: {intthresh} only applies to the current privilege mode.  There is a proposal to add a new WFMI instruction ("wait for mode's interrupts") to the privilege specification. This instruction only has to wakeup for pending-and-enabled interrupts in the current mode, and is not required to wakeup for pending-and-enabled interrupts in lower privilege modes. Pending-enabled higher privilege-mode interrupts will interrupt/wakeup as usual.

==== Synchronous Exception Handling

Horizontal synchronous exception traps, which stay within a privilege
mode, are serviced with the same interrupt level as the instruction
that raised the exception.

Vertical synchronous exception traps, which are serviced at a higher
privilege mode, are taken at interrupt level 0 in the higher privilege
mode.

WARNING: Traps should be avoided at any time when {epc}/{cause} are live
because these CSRs will be overwritten. Software should try to back them
up if needed.

==== Non-Resumable Non-Maskable Interrupts

The handling of NMIs is implementation-specific, but NMIs are always
handled in M-mode and can overwrite `mepc` and `mcause` of an active
M-mode CLIC interrupt handler.

==== Resumable Non-Maskable Interrupts

NOTE: This section describes the interaction of the CLIC with the
proposed new RNMI specification.

The resumable NMI (RNMI) extension adds additional `mnepc`, `mncause`,
and `mnstatus` CSRs.  The RNMI CSRs are separate from the CLIC CSRs and so CLIC state does not need to be saved in RNMI CSRs.
This makes the design of the RNMI extension orthogonal to the hart's general interrupt scheme.

==== Returns from Handlers

As stated in the RISC-V Privilege Specification,
when executing an xRET instruction, supposing xPP holds the value y, xIE is set to xPIE; the
privilege mode is changed to y; xPIE is set to 1; and xPP is set to the least-privileged supported
mode.  The {ret} instruction sets the pc to the value stored in the {epc} register.
Additionally in CLIC mode, {ret} sets {intstatus}.{il} to {pintstatus}.{pil}.
The {ret} instruction does not modify the {pintstatus}.{pil} field in {pintstatus}.

==== New Interrupt-Level Threshold ({sintthresh}) CSR

The interrupt-level threshold ({sintthresh}) is a new read-write WARL CSR,
which holds an 8-bit field (`th`) for the threshold level of the
supervisor privilege mode.  The `th` field is held in the least-significant
8 bits of the CSR, and zero should be written to the upper bits.

=== ssclic CLIC Reset Behavior

Interrupt level 0 corresponds to regular
execution outside of an interrupt handler.

NOTE: For an S-mode execution environment, the EEI should specify
that {sstatus}.`sie` is also reset on entry. It is then responsibility of
the execution environment to ensure that is true before beginning execution
in S-mode.

==== State Enable

If the Smstateen extension is implemented, then the bit 53 (CLIC) in mstateen0 is
implemented. If bit 53 (CLIC) of a controlling mstateen0 CSR is zero, then
access to the new CSRs ({stvt}, {snxti}, {sintstatus}, {sintthresh},
{sscratchcsw}, {sscratchcswl}) by S-mode or a lower privilege mode
results in an illegal instruction exception, except if the hypervisor
extension is implemented and the conditions for a virtual instruction
exception apply, in which case a virtual instruction exception is
raised when in VS or VU mode instead of an illegal instruction
exception.



== Support for selective hardware vectored interrupts - smclicshv
This extension requires smclicincr and smclic.
 
The selective hardware vectoring extension adds the ability for each interrupt
to be configured to use hardware vectoring or software vectoring.
Interrupts are always software vectored if smclicshv isn't supported when in CLIC mode.
When a hardware vectored interrupt is taken, the hart hardware loads the vector
table entry for the associated interrupt (table pointed to {mtvt} CSR),
masks off the least-significant bit (for IALIGN=16) or masks of the 2 least-significant bits (for IALIGN=32),
and then jumps to the masked address.
The masked vector table entry bit(s) are reserved and should be zero.
When a software vectored interrupt is taken, the hart jumps to the address in the {tvec} CSR and then
it is software's responsibility to load the vector table entry for the associated interrupt
and jump to the address in that entry.

Hardware vectoring has the advantage of lower interrupt latency at the price of a slight
increase in code size because each hardware vectored interrupt has its own code to perform context save/restore.
Software vectoring has the advantage of smaller code size by sharing code to perform context save/restore
at the price of slightly higher interrupt latency. 

=== smclicshv Changes to CLIC Registers

==== smclicshv Changes to CLIC Interrupt Pending (`clicintip`)

When the input is configured for edge-sensitive input,
hardware clears the associated interrupt pending bit when a
hardware vectored interrupt is serviced.
See additional details on hardware clearing in the {tvec} section.

NOTE: To improve performance, when a hardware vectored interrupt is selected
and serviced, the hardware automatically clears its corresponding
edge-triggered pending bit, so software doesn't need to clear the
pending bit in the service routine.

In contrast, when a software vectored interrupt is selected,
the hardware will not automatically clear an edge-triggered pending
bit. 

==== smclicshv Changes to CLIC Interrupt Attribute (`clicintattr`)

This is an 8-bit WARL read-write register to specify various attributes for each interrupt.

.clicintattr register layout
include::images/wavedrom/clicintattr.edn[]

The 1-bit `shv` field is used for Selective Hardware Vectoring.
If `shv` is 0, it assigns this interrupt to be software vectored and thus it jumps
to the common code at {tvec}.
If `shv` is 1, it assigns this interrupt to be hardware vectored and thus it
automatically jumps to the trap-handler function pointer specified in {tvt} CSR.
This feature allows some interrupts to all jump to a common base address held
in {tvec}, while the others are vectored in hardware via a table pointed to
by the additional {tvt} CSR.

=== smclicshv Changes to CLIC CSRs


==== New {mtvt} CSR

The {mtvt} WARL XLEN-bit CSR holds the base address of the trap vector
table, aligned on a 64-byte or greater power-of-two boundary. The actual
alignment can be determined by writing ones to the low-order bits then reading
them back. Values other than 0 in the low 6 bits of {mtvt} are reserved.

The value of {mtvt} CSR is also used when the smclicshv exception is present
and `clicintattr[__i__].shv` = 1 (hardware vectored interrupt).

  M[a]   = Contents of memory address at address "a"
  VTMASK = ~0x1 if IALIGN=16 or ~0x3 if IALIGN=32
----

In CLIC mode, writing `0` to `clicintattr[__i__].shv`
sets interrupt `i` to software vectored,
where the hart jumps to the
trap handler address held in the upper XLEN-2 bits of
{tvec} for all exceptions and interrupts in privilege mode
`**__x__**`.

On the other hand, writing `1` to `clicintattr[__i__].shv`
sets interrupt `i` to hardware vectored. When these interrupts are taken, the hart
switches to the handler's privilege mode, and performs the trap side effects described in this and the privileged specification (e.g. update {intstatus}, {pintstatus}, {cause}, {status} fields including clearing {status}.{ie}).
At this time, if the associated interrupt pending bit is configured for edge-sensitive input, it is cleared by hardware. The hart then fetches an XLEN-bit handler
address with permissions corresponding to the handler's mode from the in-memory table whose base address (VTBASE) is in
{tvt}.  The trap handler function address is fetched from
`VTBASE+XLEN/8*exccode`.  If the fetch is successful, the hart
clears the low bit of the handler address and sets the PC to this handler
address.
If the trap handler function address fetch is unsuccessful and a exception trap occurs,
the {inhv} bit in {pintstatus} of the exception handler privilege mode is set indicating that {epc} of
the exception handler privilege mode contains a trap handler function address instead of the virtual address of an instruction.

The overall effect is:

     pc := M[VTBASE + XLEN/8 * exccode] & VTMASK

----

NOTE: The CLINT vectored mode simply jumps to an address in
the trap vector table, while the CLIC hardware vectored mode reads a
handler function address from the table, and jumps to it in hardware.

NOTE: The vector table contains vector addresses rather than
instructions because it simplifies static initialization in C.
More specifically, the entries in the table are simple XLEN-bit
function pointers.

NOTE: The hardware vectoring bit {inhv} is provided to allow resumable
traps on fetches to the vector table.

When a trap is taken, the {inhv} bit is set by hardware to indicate if {epc} is the address of a table entry
or cleared by hardware to indicate if {epc} is the address of an instruction.
The {inhv} bit is only set by hardware if an exception occurs during the table vector
read operation.  The {inhv} bit can be written by software, including
when hardware vectoring is not in effect. The {inhv} bit has no effect
except when returning using an {ret} instruction.

When returning from an {ret} instruction, the {inhv} bit modifies behavior
as follows:

If the {inhv} bit is set, the hart
resumes the trap handler memory access to retrieve the function
pointer for vectoring with permissions corresponding to the previous
privilege mode.
The trap handler function address is obtained from the current
privilege mode's `xepc` with the low bits of the address cleared to
force the access to be naturally aligned to an XLEN/8-byte table entry.
If the fetch is successful, the hart
clears the low bit(s) (depending on IALIGN) of the handler address and sets the PC to this handler
address.

----

NOTE: The {inhv} bit when set at xRET informs hardware to repeat the table fetch using the address in xEPC to obtain the address of the trap handler that is then written to the PC instead of directly writing xEPC to the PC.  One of the goals of this behavior is to avoid complicating the critical code paths for handling virtual memory in the more-privileged layer. The more-privileged layer does not have to distinguish CLIC vector table reads from other forms of page faults and can handle them using exactly the same code.

For permissions-checking purposes, the memory access to retrieve the
function pointer for hardware vectoring is an _implicit_ fetch at the
privilege mode of the interrupt handler, and requires execute
permission; read permission is irrelevant.

NOTE: software vectoring will need vector table read permission.

If there is an access exception on the table fetch, {epc} is written with the faulting address.  {tval} is either set to zero or written with the faulting address.

NOTE: For simpler systems, we do not require that {tval} is written
with the faulting address.  For systems with demand paging, {tval}
should be written with the faulting address to simplify page-fault
handling code.

NOTE: Interrupted context is lost on horizontal traps during table fetch where exceptions are the same privilege mode as the interrupt handler. The interesting case is vertical traps, where a more privileged layer is handling page faults or other synchronous faults for the less privileged mode vector table access. The regular code path in more privileged layer will want to use xtval to determine what bad virtual address to page in, but will not normally restore xtval when returning to faulting context (potentially after some time and other contexts have run). However, it will restore xepc (using x for more privileged mode here) before using xret on normal code path.  This is a rationale for why both {tval} and {epc} are recommended to be written with the faulting address in systems with demand paging.

Memory writes to the vector table require an instruction barrier (_fence.i_) to guarantee that they are visible to the instruction fetch.

==== smclicshv Changes to {epc} CSRs

The {epc} CSRs behave the same in both modes, capturing the PC at
which execution was interrupted.  In CLIC mode, the {epc} CSR additionally holds the faulting address if there is an access exception on the table fetch during hardware vectoring.

==== smclicshv Changes to `dpc` CSR

For implicit hardware vector table fetches, whether breakpoints trap
on the table read is left as an implementation option. For explicit
loads used in software vectoring, watchpoints operate as normal for
any load.  In CLIC mode, the `dpc` CSR additionally may hold the
faulting address if breakpoints are allowed to trap on the table fetch
during hardware vectoring.  If breakpoints are allowed to trap on the
table read, dret should honor {inhv}.


== Interrupt trigger Debug extension- smclicdbg

=== CLIC Interrupt Trigger (`clicinttrig`)

Optional interrupt triggers (`clicinttrig[__i__]`) are used to generate
a breakpoint exception, entry into Debug Mode, or a trace action.
If these registers are not implemented, they appear as hard-wired zeros.

NOTE: The notation [__i__] for the clicinttrig register in this section treats __i__ not an interrupt number
but is instead as a trigger number.

This logic is intended to be used with `tmexttrigger`.`intctl`` as described in the RISC-V debug specification.

Each interrupt trigger is a 32-bit WARL register with the
following layout:

.clicinttrig register layout
include::images/wavedrom/clicinttrig.edn[]

The `interrupt_number` field selects which number of interrupt input
is used as the source for this interrupt trigger.

The `nxti_enable` control bit is read-write to enable/disable this
interrupt trigger when using accesses of {nxti} that include writes.  A trigger is signaled to the debug module if the interrupt code from a write access to {nxti} matches a `clicinttrig[__i__]`.interrupt_number and the associated `clicinttrig[__i__]`.nxti_enable is set.

The `interrupt_trap_enable` control bit is read-write to enable/disable this
interrupt trigger.  A trigger is signaled to the debug module if an interrupt trap is taken and the interrupt code matches a `clicinttrig[__i__]`.interrupt_number and the associated `clicinttrig[__i__]`.interrupt_trap_enable is set.

== Smcspsw Conditional Stack Pointer Swap extension

For security and stack safety reasons, it can be desired to separate the stack areas per privilege level and between traps and normal execution.
Performing stack pointer swaping in SW can be time consuming, as the conditions for swapping have to be checked first.
However, stack pointer swapping is among the first things that need to happen even before saving the interrupted context.
To ensure fast interrupt handling, this extension introduces an instruction to accelerate conditional stack pointer swapping.

=== Separate stacks per privilege mode

The stack separation per privilege mode is controlled through the xsp CSR.
If this reads the value zero, no conditional stack swap is performed.
Else, the xcspw instruction can be used to atomically swap the stack pointer with the xsp register if a mode change happened.

[source]
----
      Number  Name         Description
(NEW) 0x348   msp          Stack pointer for conditional swap (WARL)
----

This mechanism can also be used to initialize the sp value of a less privileged mode.
If an operating system manages separate stacks per software thread in a lower privileged mode, this mechanism can also be applied.

=== Separate stacks for interrupts

The same instruction can be used to separate the stack of non-interrupt execution from interrupts at the same privilege level.
This is beneficial to ensure the integrity of the interrupts stack independently of the non-interrupt stack.
The interrupt stack pointer at a given privilege level has to be initialized by writing to the xtsp CSR.
If using xcspsw to swap stack pointers before changing to a lower privilege level, the current value of sp will be used as stack pointer in trap handling at the current privilege level. 
After a trap, the xcspw instruction will swap the previous sp with the value in xsp if {insert CSR here}.xtspsw is asserted.

=== xcspsw

The xcspsw instruction conditional swaps the sp register with the xsp register.

Encoding tbd. Assume this includes the PRIV field.

Behavior:

[source]
----

# Stack pointer swap condition (SPSC) in a trap handler:
exception_spsc = true if exception was taken from (xil == 0)
interrupt_spsc = (xil == 0) != (xpil == 0)
trap_spsc = exception_spsc or interrupt_spsc

if ((xsp != 0) and (trap_spsc or (PRIV != xpp)))
{
  tmp = sp
  sp = xsp
  xsp = tmp
}
----

== Sscspsw Conditional Stack Pointer Swap extension

The Sscspsw depends on the Smcspsw extension.

It adds a new supervisor level CSR ssp.

[source]
----
      Number  Name         Description
(NEW) 0x148   ssp          Stack pointer for conditional swap (WARL)
----

If ssp reads a non-zero value, the xcspsw conditionally perfoms a stack pointer swap with ssp.
The behavior is analogous to Smcspsw.

== Smtp Trap handler push and pop extension

The trap handler push and pop extension adds instructions to accelerate trap handling, which additionally reduce code size.
Trap handler latency and jitter is reduced by allowing the context save to happen speculatively in parallel to the vector table and handler fetch.
Additional latency reduction is achieved by allowing late-preemption of the push sequence in favor of a higher priority interrupt or synchronous exception.
Trap handling throughput is increased by allowing tail-chaing of interrupts or synchronous exceptions, skipping the context restore and save in between servicing two handlers.
The instructions are designed to be applicable to all RISC-V trap handling schemes.

Assumed general changes not covered here:

* The trap behavior needs to be modified to clear the ip bit upon completion of tpush, rather than as soon as the vector table access happens.

=== Trap handler push and pop functional overview

1. The tpush instruction
* Conditionally performs a stack pointer swap by executing xcspsw
* Saves hart's state of the preempted context that can be overwritten in case of a nested preemption
* Save registers x10-x15 (these are the caller saved registers available in RVC)
* Adjusts the stack pointer to create the stack frame
* Clear the ip bit if writable
* Write trap information to argument registers
* Optionally, enable interrupts and clear the xstatus.XDT flag if the double trap extension is implemented at the current privilege level

NOTE: If a trap occurs during the sequence, then any operations which were executed before the trap may update architectural state and/or memory contents.
The preempting trap is expected to fully save and restore the architectural state that it overwrites.
If the trap occurs before updating the stack pointer, it needs to be assumed that the stacked context was overwritten.
In this case, if the instruction is resumed, any store operations must be re-executed.

The tpush instruction writes the value of the xcause CSR into register a0.
This is beneficial also with vectored interrupts, as it allows sharing the same handler for similar interrupt sources.
For example, if a peripheral exists multiple times in a system at different offsets, this can be handled with one handler.

The following table summarizes the written trap information:

[%autowidth]
|===
| Register | synchronous exception | interrupt
| a0       | xcause | xcause
| a1       | xtval | no write
| a2       | xtval2 | no write
| a3       | xtinst | no write
|===

Software shall only use the information from the argument registers, as the corresponding CSRs may be overwritten by preempting traps.
The values of xtval, xtval2, and xinst only need to be written to an argument register if the corresponding exception cause a write to the respective CSR.

2. The tpopxret instruction
* Disables interrupts
* Set the xstatus.XDT flag if the double trap extension is implemented at the current privilege level
* Restores registers x10-x15
* Restores the the hart's state to the point that the hart can return to the interrupted context
* Adjust the stack pointer to destroy the stack frame
* Conditionally performs a stack pointer swap by executing xcspsw
* Executes an xret according to the current level

NOTE: If a trap occurs during the sequence, then any operations which were executed before the trap may update architectural state.
A trap may not occur after updating the stack pointer, if the context was not yet fully restored from the stack.

There is no specific order mandated for the context save/restore, and the individual parts may occur in parallel.
Interrupts shall not be enabled before completing the context save/restore operations of the tpush instruction.
Interrupts must be disabled before starting to restore context in the tpopxret instruction.
As interrupts are disabled during the sequence as a side effect of the trap being taken, intermediate states during the execution of the instruction are not observable.

If the Smtp extension is implemented, the first and last instructions of a trap handler must be a tpush and the last a tpopxret instruction, respectively.
If an tpush or tpopxret instruction is used outside of these two scenarios, an illegal-instruction exception shall be raised.

NOTE: In contrast to the Zcmp push/pop intructions, Smtp instructions do not encode an incremental stack pointer adjustment in order to ease late preemption and tail chaining.

With these requirements, implementations are allowed to speculatively start executing an tpush instruction in case of a taken interrupt.

=== Late Preemption of the interrupt handler

While executing the tpush instruction, a hart may optionally check for higher priority/level pending and enabled interrupts at the current privilege mode, and switch to fetching this trap handler instead.
Once the instruction retires, or the interrupts are disabled, no late preemption can occur.

=== Tail chaining of interrupts handlers

While executing the tpopxret instruction, a hart may optionally check for any pending and enabled interrupts at the current privilege mode.
If such an interrupt exists, the hart may abort executing the tpopxret instruction and trigger the following actions:
  - Update the xcause.exccode to the corresponding interrupt id.
  - Perform the trap handler fetch.
  - Start excuting the trap handler, while skipping the portions of tpush that have not been reverted by the aborted tpopxret.

Explicitly, xepc, xpil, and xpp remain unchanged.

NOTE: In the typical case of tail chaining, the check for another pending enabled interrupt is done after disabling interrupts at the start of the tpopxret instruction. In this case, only the conditional interrupt enablement of the tpush instruction would need to executed.

Once the instruction retires, or the interrupts are disabled, no late preemption can occur.

=== Stack layout

To ease debugging, a stack layout is specified for the saved context.

#TODO: find the best way to specify the memory layout in asciidoc

* xtvec.mode != CLIC:
** XXLEN = 32:

stack pointer adjustment: 32

24: x15

20: x14

16: x13

12: x12

8: x11

4: x10

** XXLEN = 64:

stack pointer adjustment: 48

48: x15

40: x14

32: x13

24: x12

16: x11

8: x10

* xtvec.mode = CLIC:

start of stackframe remains same. In addition:

** XXLEN = 32

stack pointer adjustment: 32

32: xpintstatus (XXLEN)

28: xpepc (XXLEN)

** XXLEN = 32

stack pointer adjustment: 64

60: xpintstatus (XXLEN)

56: xpepc (XXLEN)

=== Fault handling

According the the Machine Level ISA, trap handlers must be designed to not cause exceptions during their critical section.
This applies to the tpush and tpopxret instruction.
Therefore, by design, it must be guaranteed that no faults occur during the execution of these instructions.

=== Debug

As the execution of tpush may start before the instruction is fetched, breakpoint conditions met might observe an inconsistent state.
Therefore, if a breakpoint is triggered because of an tpush instruction, the breakpoint shall be handled as if it occured on the subsequent instruction.

=== Instructions

#TODO: define encodings, sail etc.

==== tpush

==== tpopxret

== CLIC Parameters

Although these are described as parameters, it is understood that hardware implementations may wish to
have a single implementation support different parameterizations of CLIC extensions and may make
these values configurable and initialized prior to CLIC operation. 
However, these parameters should functionally be considered static. If the value of these parameters are changed
during CLIC operation, CLIC behavior is undefined.

=== NVBITS Parameter - Specifying Support for smclicshv Selective Interrupt Hardware Vectoring Extension

The NVBITS Parameter specifies whether
the smclicshv extension is implemented or not.

When NVBITS is 0, the smclicshv extension is not implemented.
In this case, all CLIC interrupts are software vectored and are directed to the common code
at {tvec} register.

When NVBITS is 1, smclicshv extension is implemented.

=== CLICINFO Parameters

The NUM_INTERRUPT 13-bit parameter from 2-4096 that specifies the actual number of maximum interrupt
inputs supported in this implementation. MSIP, MTIP are always included.

The VERSION 8-bit parameter specifies the implementation version of CLIC. The upper
4-bit specifies the architecture version, and the lower 4-bit specifies
the implementation version.

The NUM_TRIGGER 6-bit parameter specifies the number of maximum interrupt
triggers supported in this implementation. Valid values are 0 to 32.
